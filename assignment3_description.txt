a3_wordfrequency.pde written by Daniel
This Processing program visualizes the frequencies of words in the book
The Last Spaceship, as well as the number of words with those frequencies.
The frequency values are visualized with a color and the position of a
block along the X-Axis. The size of the block depicts how many words have
that frequency.

Some extra features in this program that weren't requested includes the
ability to freely rezise the window with the graphics scaling to fit.
Additionally, the program is optimized to only calculate how graphical
elements should be drawn only once every time the window is resized.
