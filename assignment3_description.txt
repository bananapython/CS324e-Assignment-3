a3_novelvisualization.pde written by Alan Tang
This Processing program visualizes a random assortment of the unique words 
in the novel The Last Spaceship. These words are grabbed from a text file
uniquewords.txt. They are then put in a random order with consistent
spacing and do not run over the edge of the canvas.

The words are sorted by different colors based off of the word length. The
three categories are short words (5 letters or less), medium words (6-8 letters), 
and long words (9+ letters). Short words are a lime like green, medium are blue,
and long are copper. These colors were chosen because they fit well together in
a pallette but are still distinct enough to show the diction in a novel (which I
felt was really interesting to look at).

The font chosen was Oswald because I felt it matched the space theme of the novel.
The font size is 28 because it is a happy medium between having too many words and
not really being able to distinguish any and having too little. This helps to see the
trend of the types of words the novel uses.

Lastly, the program has the additional feature of resetting the canvas with different 
words by clicking on it.

a3_wordfrequency.pde written by Daniel
This Processing program visualizes the frequencies of words in the book
The Last Spaceship, as well as the number of words with those frequencies.
The frequency values are visualized with a color and the position of a
block along the X-Axis. The size of the block depicts how many words have
that frequency.

Some extra features in this program that weren't requested includes the
ability to freely rezise the window with the graphics scaling to fit.
Additionally, the program is optimized to only calculate how graphical
elements should be drawn only once every time the window is resized.
