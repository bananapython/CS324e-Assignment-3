he
regarded
a
placard
under
the

with
a
grim
and
entirely
mirthless
amusement
he
was
unshaven
and
hollow
cheeked
he
was
even
ragged
he
was
a
pariah
because
he
had
tried
to
strike
at
the
very
foundation
of
civilization
he
stood

this

a

those
which
for
ten
thousand

were
the
only
means
of
travel
between
planets
and

systems
even
after

space
ships
continued
to
be
used
for
exploration
for
many
years
since
exploration

used
by

when
the
first
human
colonists
came
in
it
to
alphin

bringing
with
them
the

rendell
read
it
again
he
was
haggard
and
hungry
he
had
been
guilty
of
the
most
horrifying
crime
imaginable
to
a
man
of
his
time
but
the
law
would
not
of
course
allow
him
or
any
other
man
to
be
coerced
by
any
violence
or
threat
to
his
personal
liberty
freedom
was
the
law
on
alphin
iii
a
wryly
humorous
law
no
man
could
be
punished
no
man
could
have
any
violence
offered
him
theoretically
the
individual
was
free
as
men
had
never
been
free
before
in
all
of
human
history
despite
kim
s
crime
this
space
ship
still
belonged
to
him
and
it
could
not
be
taken
from
him
yet
he
was
hungry
and
he
would
remain
hungry
he
was
shabby
and
he
would
grow
shabbier
this
was
the
only
roof
on
alphin
iii
which
would
shelter
him
and
this
solely
because
the
law
would
not
permit
any
man
to
be
excluded
from
his
rightful
possessions
a
lector
came
up
to
him
and
bowed
politely
citizen
he
said
apologetically
may
i
speak
to
you
why
not
asked
kim
grimly
i
am
not
proud
the
lector
said
uncomfortably
i
see
that
you
are
in
difficulty
your
clothes
are
threadbare
then
he
added
with
unhappy
courtesy
you
are
a
criminal
are
you
not
i
am
blocked
said
kim
in
a
hard
voice
i
was
advised
by
the
prime
board
to
leave
alphin
three
for
my
own
benefit
i
refused
they
put
on
the
first
block
automatically
after
that
the
other
blocks
came
on
one
each
day
i
have
not
eaten
for
three
days
i
suppose
you
would
call
me
a
criminal
i
sympathize
deeply
the
lector
answered
unhappily
i
hope
that
soon
you
will
concede
the
wisdom
of
the
advised
action
and
be
civilized
again
but
may
i
ask
how
you
entered
the
museum
the
third
block
prevents
entrance
to
all
places
of
study
kim
pointed
to
the
loan
card
i
am
kim
rendell
he
said
drily
the
law
does
not
allow
me
to
be
prevented
access
to
my
own
property
i
insisted
on
my
right
to
visit
this
ship
and
the
disciplinary
circuit
for
this
building
had
to
be
turned
off
at
the
door
so
i
could
enter
he
shivered
it
is
very
cold
out
of
doors
today
and
i
could
not
enter
any
other
building
the
lector
looked
relieved
i
am
glad
to
know
these
things
he
said
gratefully
thank
you
he
glanced
at
kim
with
a
sort
of
fluttered
curiosity
it
is
most
interesting
to
meet
a
criminal
what
was
your
crime
kim
looked
at
him
under
scowling
brows
i
tried
to
nullify
the
disciplinary
circuit
the
lector
blinked
at
him
fascinated
then
walked
hastily
away
as
if
frightened
kim
rendell
stooped
under
the
railing
and
approached
the
starshine
the
entrance
port
was
open
and
a
flush
ladder
led
up
to
it
kim
hollow
cheeked
and
ragged
and
defiant
climbed
the
steps
and
entered
the
entry
port
gave
upon
a
vestibule
which
kim
knew
from
his
grandfather
s
tables
to
be
an
airlock
kim
s
grandfather
had
once
gone
off
into
space
in
the
starshine
with
his
father
it
was
possibly
the
last
space
flight
ever
made
for
a
hundred
years
now
the
ship
had
been
a
museum
piece
open
to
public
inspection
but
parts
had
been
sealed
off
as
uninstructive
kim
broke
the
seals
this
was
his
property
but
if
he
had
not
already
been
a
criminal
under
block
the
breaking
of
the
seals
would
have
made
him
one
at
least
it
would
have
had
to
be
explained
to
a
lector
who
at
discretion
could
accept
the
explanation
or
refer
it
to
a
second
degree
counsellor
the
counsellor
might
deplore
the
matter
and
dismiss
it
or
suggest
corrective
self
discipline
if
the
seal
breaker
did
not
accept
the
suggestion
the
matter
would
go
to
a
social
board
whose
suggestion
in
turn
could
be
rejected
but
when
it
reached
the
prime
board
and
any
matter
from
the
breaking
of
a
seal
to
mass
murder
would
go
there
if
suggested
self
discipline
was
refused
there
was
no
more
nonsense
kim
s
case
had
reached
the
prime
board
instantly
and
he
had
been
advised
to
leave
alphin
iii
for
his
own
good
his
crime
was
monstrous
but
he
had
ironically
refused
exile
now
he
was

of
his

these

arrived
by

in

took
away

an
attempt
to
pass

door

caused

to
act
his

tingle
he
could
turn
back
then
if
he
persisted
the
tingling
became
more
severe
if
he
was
obstinate
it
became
agony
which
continued
until
he
turned
back
on
the
third
day
he
found
it
impossible
to
enter

the

he
had
accomplished

the

toward

he
felt
an
infinitesimal
tingling
all
over
his

he
stood
rigid
for
a
second
and
then
smiled
grimly
he
closed
the

of
the
catalyzer
he
had
examined

worked
on
just
in

he

brutes
he
moved
from

came
up

into

turned
his

bent
over

amazingly
showed
the

to
be
almost
one
twelfth
full

stood
motionless
the

there
presently
they
came
cautiously
to

kim

not
stir
a

made
an
indescribable
sound
of
satisfaction

not
moving

his

outside

he
did
not

with
a
quite
extraordinary
air
of
someone
about

pick
up

inanimate

what

this

gasped

dropped
open

his

you
were
paralyzed
i
do
not

what
you

said
it
is
against
the
law
for
any

to
lay
violent
hands
upon

by
an

the

regained
his
self

you
you
the

you
reported
that

kim
said
drily
there
is
some
uneasiness
about
what
i
do
because
of
my
crime
so
the
circuit
was
applied
to
paralyze
me
and
you
were
ordered
to
bring
me
quietly
to
the
matter
transmitter
as
you
observe
it
is
not
practical
go
back
and
report
it
the

said
something
incoherent
turned
and
fled
kim
followed
him
leisurely
to
the
entry
port
he
turned
the
hand
power
wheels
which
put
a
barrier
across
the
entrance
he
went
back
to
his
examination
of
the
ship
the
first
part
of
the
impossible
had
been
achieved
but
there
was
much
more
too
much
more
which
must
be
done
he
worked
feverishly
his
grandfather
had
told
him
many
tales
of
the
starshine
she
had
made
voyages
of
as
long
as
two
years
in
emptiness
at
full
acceleration
during
which
she
had
covered
four
hundred
light
years
of
space
had
purified
her
air
and
fed
her
crew
her
tanks
could
hold
fuel
for
six
years
drive
at
full
acceleration
and
her
food
synthesizers
primitive
as
they
were
by
modern
standards
could
yet
produce
some
four
hundred
foodstuffs
from
the
carbon
hydrogen
nitrogen
and
traces
of
other
elements
into
which
almost
any
organic
raw
material
could
be
resolved
she
was
in
fact
one
of
the
last
and
most
useful
space
ships
ever
constructed
at
the
last
space
ship
yard
in
existence
she
was
almost
certainly
the
last
ever
to
be
used
but
she
was
only
a
museum
piece
now
and
her
switches
were
opened
and
her
control
cables
severed
lest
visitors
to
the
museum
injure
her
but
kim
s
grandfather
had
lectured
him
at
great
length
upon
her
qualities
the
old
gentleman
had
had
an
elderly
man
s
distaste
for
modern
perfectionism
kim
threw
switches
here
and
there
he
spliced
cables
wherever
he
found
them
cut
he
was
hungry
and
he
was
gaunt
and
he
worked
with
a
bitter
anticipation
of
failure
he
had
been
in
the
museum
for
almost
an
hour
and
in
the
ship
for
half
of
that
when
voices
called
politely
through
the
barrier
grille
citizen
kim
rendell
may
we
enter
he
made
sure
it
was
safe
then
opened
the
way
enter
and
welcome
citizens
he
said
ironically
in
the
prescribed
formula
but
his
hands
were
clenched
and
he
was
all
ready
to
fight
for
his
life
break
for
freedom
slowly
the
prime
board
of
alphin
iii
filed
up
the
flush
ladder
and
into
the
cabin
of
the
starshine
there
was
malby
who
looked
like
an
elderly
sheep
there
was
ponter
who
rather
resembled
an
immature
frog
there
was
shimlo
who
did
not
look
like
anything
but
an
advanced
case
of
benevolent
imbecility
and
burt
who
at
least
looked
intelligent
and
whom
kim
rendell
hated
with
a
corrosive
hatred
greeting
citizen
malby
said
even
his
voice
had
a
bleating
quality
despite
your
crime
we
have
broken
all
precedent
to
come
and
reason
with
you
you
are
not
mad
yet
you
act
like
a
madman
kim
grinned
savagely
at
him
come
now
i
found
a
material
that
changes
a
man
s
psychogram
so
he
s
immune
to
the
disciplinary
circuit
i
was
immune
to
discipline
so
you
four
had
me
seized
and
my
little
amulet
taken
away
from
me
and
then
you
sealed
up
every
other
bit
of
that
material
on
the
planet
not
so
naturally
burt
said
pleasantly
the
disciplinary
circuit
is
the
basis
of
civilization
nowadays
all
discipline
and
hence
all
civilization
would
cease
if
the
circuit
were
nullified
naturally
you
must
be
disposed
of
but
carefully
so
if
there
is
anyone
who
shares
my
secret
he
ll
be
betrayed
by
trying
to
help
me
said
kim
and
quietly
too
so
those
amiable
sheep
my
fellow
citizens
won
t
suspect
there
s
anything
wrong
they
don
t
realize
that
they
re
slaves
they
don
t
know
of
your
pleasure
palaces
on
the
other
side
of
the
planet
they
don
t
realize
that
when
you
take
a
fancy
to
a
woman
and
she
s
blocked
in
her
quarters
until
she
s
hysterical
with
fear
and
loneliness
you
advise
her
to
take
psychological
treatments
which
make
her
a
submissive
inmate
of
the
harems
you
keep
there
they
don
t
know
what
happens
to
men
you
put
under
block
for
being
too
inquisitive
about
those
women
and
who
enter
the
matter
transmitter
for
exile
burt
looked
mildly
inquiring
what
does
happen
to
them
ades
kim
said
furiously
they
go
to
the
transmitter
and
name
their
chosen
place
of
exile
and
the
transmitter
clerk
dutifully
pushes
the
proper
buttons
but
the
circuit
takes
over
they
go
to
ades
and
no
man
has
ever
come
back
there
was
a
sudden
tension
in
the
air
burt
looked
at
his
fellows
shimlo
was
the
picture
of
benevolent
indignation
but
his
eyes
were
ugly
ponter
opened
his
mouth
and
closed
it
absurdly
looking
more
than
ever
like
a
frog
this
is
monstrous
malby
bleated
this
is
monstrous
burt
held
up
his
hand
how
did
you
get
this
strange
idea
he
asked
i
m
a
matter
transmitter
technician
fourth
grade
kim
said
coldly
i
worked
on
the
transmitter
when
it
gave
trouble
i
found
the
disciplinary
circuit
tie
in
i
traced
it
so
i
knew
there
was
something
wrong
about
all
personal
freedom
on
alphin
iii
and
i
started
to
look
for
more
things
wrong
i
found
them
i
started
to
do
something
about
them
then
i
got
caught
burt
nodded
so
he
said
thoughtfully
we
underestimated
you
kim
rendell
it
is
much
pleasanter
to
rule
alphin
three
as
beloved
citizens
than
as
admitted
tyrants
there
are
times
when
we
have
to
protect
ourselves
naturally
we
would
rather
not
show
our
hands
it
is
clear
that
you
must
be
sent
into
exile
frankly
to
ades
whatever
it
may
be
like
there
apparently
you
did
not
have
any
friends
i
dared
not
trust
any
of
the
sheep
you
rule
kim
said
angrily
but
i
did
know
there
was
more
hafnium
on
this
ship
i
didn
t
dare
come
at
first
or
you
d
have
guessed
but
after
i
d
starved
a
bit
and
was
convincingly
cold
i
risked
the
venture
you
guessed
my
intention
too
late
i
can
defy
you
again
even
if
you
did
take
away
my
first
protection
from
the
circuit
you
know
that
burt
nodded
again
of
course
he
admitted
yet
we
do
not
want
a
scandal
we
will
make
a
bargain
within
limits
you
must
be
disposed
of
but
we
will
promise
that
you
can
go
wherever
you
choose
via
the
matter
transmitter
your
word
s
no
good
kim
snapped
you
will
starve
burt
said
mildly
of
course
you
can
seal
yourself
in
the
ship
but
we
will
have
lectors
special
lectors
waiting
for
you
when
you
come
out
again
kim
scowled
yes
he
said
i
ve
been
here
half
an
hour
the
ship
s
circuits
were
cut
but
i
ve
put
the
communicator
back
in
working
order
i
can
broadcast
over
the
entire
planet
telling
the
truth
i
won
t
destroy
your
power
but
i
ll
make
your
slaves
begin
to
realize
what
they
are
sooner
or
later
one
of
them
will
kill
you
malby
bleated
it
was
not
necessarily
panic
but
there
are
some
minds
to
whom
public
admiration
is
necessary
such
persons
will
commit
any
crime
to
get
admiration
which
they
crave
with
a
passionate
desire
burt
held
up
his
hand
again
but
why
tell
us
he
asked
pleasantly
why
didn
t
you
simply
broadcast
what
you
ve
learned
possibly
it
was
because
you
wished
to
bargain
with
us
first
you
have
terms
kim
ground
his
teeth
that
s
right
he
said
there
is
a
girl
dona
brett
she
was
to
marry
me
but
one
of
you
saw
her
i
think
you
burt
she
is
now
blocked
in
her
quarters
to
grow
hysterical
and
terrified
it
was
on
account
of
her
that
i
acted
too
soon
and
got
caught
i
want
her
here
burt
considered
without
perceptible
emotion
she
is
quite
pretty
but
there
are
others
he
said
in
his
detached
way
if
we
send
her
you
will
not
broadcast
i
ll
kill
her
and
myself
kim
said
it
s
apparently
the
only
service
i
can
do
her
get
out
now
it
will
take
your
best
technician
at
least
forty
minutes
to
make
a
scrambler
which
will
keep
me
from
broadcasting
i
ll
give
you
twenty
minutes
to
get
her
to
me
i
ll
talk
to
all
the
planet
if
she
isn
t
here
burt
shrugged
almost
i
overestimated
you
he
said
mildly
i
thought
you
had
an
actual
plan
very
well
she
will
come
but
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
delay
my
suicide
burt
s
eyes
gleamed
for
an
instant
then
he
went
out
followed
by
the
others
kim
worked
the
controls
which
sealed
the
ship
he
got
feverishly
to
work
again
from
time
to
time
he
stared
desperately
out
of
the
vision
ports
and
then
resumed
his
labors
his
task
seemingly
was
an
impossible
one
the
starshine
had
been
made
into
a
mere
museum
exhibit
it
was
complete
but
kim
s
knowledge
was
inadequate
and
his
time
far
too
short
eighteen
minutes
passed
before
he
saw
dona
she
stood
quietly
beside
the
railing
outside
the
space
ship
alone
and
quite
pale
he
opened
the
outer
airlock
door
she
came
up
he
closed
the
outer
door
and
opened
the
inner
she
faced
him
she
was
deathly
white
as
she
saw
him
hollow
cheeked
and
bitter
she
managed
to
smile
my
poor
kim
what
did
they
do
to
you
blocked
me
kim
cried
took
away
my
hafnium
gadget
and
put
me
on
the
circuit
they
locked
up
every
scrap
of
hafnium
on
the
planet
behind
an
all
citizen
block
they
just
didn
t
know
that
it
was
used
in
space
ships
in
the
fuel
catalyzers
i
ve
found
enough
to
make
the
two
of
us
safe
though
here
he
thrust
a
scrap
of
metal
into
her
hand
hold
it
tightly
it
has
to
touch
your
skin
she
caught
her
breath
i
was
blocked
in
my
quarters
and
i
couldn
t
come
out
she
told
him
unsteadily
i
was
going
crazy
with
terror
because
you
d
told
me
what
it
might
mean
i
tried
so
hard
to
break
through
but
flesh
and
blood
can
t
face
the
circuit
i
hadn
t
any
reason
to
hope
that
you
d
be
able
to
do
anything
but
i
did
hope
i
told
them
i
d
kill
both
of
us
he
said
fiercely
maybe
i
shall
but
if
i
can
only
find
the
right
cable
we
ll
have
a
chance
suddenly
every
muscle
in
his
body
went
rigid
and
a
screaming
torment
filled
him
it
lasted
for
part
of
a
second
his
face
went
gray
he
wetted
his
lips
burt
he
said
thickly
he
had
a
psychometer
under
his
robe
they
came
here
and
he
knew
my
psychogram
was
changed
by
the
hafnium
i
d
found
so
while
they
talked
he
stole
the
new
pattern
it
s
taken
them
this
long
to
get
it
ready
for
the
circuit
now
they
re
putting
it
in
with
a
sudden
convulsive
jerk
he
went
rigid
once
more
his
muscles
stood
out
in
great
knots
he
was
paralyzed
with
every
nerve
and
sinew
in
his
body
tensed
to
tetanic
rigor
agony
filled
him
with
an
exquisite
torment
it
was
the
disciplinary
circuit
it
was
those
waves
broadcast
focused
upon
him
at
full
power
they
would
have
found
him
anywhere
upon
the
planet
and
their
torment
was
unspeakable
dona
sobbed
suddenly
kim
she
cried
desperately
i
know
you
can
hear
me
listen
they
must
have
me
on
the
circuit
too
only
what
you
gave
me
has
thrown
it
off
they
expect
to
hold
us
paralyzed
while
they
cut
in
with
torches
and
take
us
but
they
mustn
t
so
i
m
going
to
give
you
the
thing
you
gave
me
if
it
changed
my
pattern
it
will
change
yours
again
to
something
they
can
t
guess
at
she
sobbed
again
please
kim
don
t
give
it
back
go
ahead
and
do
what
you
planned
whatever
it
is
and
if
you
don
t
win
out
please
kill
me
before
you
give
up
please
i
don
t
want
to
be
conditioned
to
do
whatever
they
want
in
their
pleasure
palaces
she
took
the
tiny
sliver
of
metal
in
her
shaking
fingers
she
pushed
aside
the
flesh
of
her
hand
to
put
it
in
his
grip
courageously
she
released
it
the
agonized
paralysis
left
kim
rendell
but
now
dona
was
a
pitiful
figure
of
agony
kim
groaned
rage
filled
him
his
anguish
and
fury
was
so
terrible
that
he
would
have
destroyed
the
whole
planet
had
he
been
able
but
he
could
not
permit
her
gift
which
she
had
given
at
the
price
of
such
torment
to
go
without
reward
he
must
struggle
on
to
save
them
both
even
though
now
he
had
no
hope
he
sprang
to
the
control
board
he
stabbed
at
buttons
almost
at
random
hoping
for
a
response
he
d
tried
to
get
the
ship
into
some
sort
of
operating
condition
but
now
there
was
no
time
frenziedly
he
attempted
to
find
some
combination
of
controls
which
would
make
something
anything
happen
he
slipped
the
second
bit
of
hafnium
into
his
mouth
to
have
both
hands
free
in
desperation
he
ripped
the
control
board
panel
loose
he
saw
clipped
wires
everywhere
behind
it
seizing
the
dangling
ends
he
struck
them
fiercely
together
a
lurid
blue
spark
leaped
he
cried
out
in
triumph
and
the
morsel
of
metal
dona
had
sacrificed
to
him
dropped
from
his
lips
his
muscles
contorted
and
agony
filled
him
there
was
a
roaring
noise
the
starshine
bucked
violently
there
were
crashes
and
there
was
a
feeling
of
intolerable
weight
which
he
could
feel
despite
his
agony
the
ship
reeled
crazily
it
smashed
through
a
wall
it
battered
into
a
roof
it
spun
like
a
mad
thing
and
went
skyward
tail
first
with
kim
rendell
in
frozen
helpless
torment
holding
two
cables
together
with
muscles
utterly
beyond
his
control
it
went
up
toward
empty
space
in
which
no
other
vessel
was
navigating
anywhere
rays
of
destruction
eventually
the
starshine
alone
in
space
as
no
other
space
ship
had
been
alone
in
twenty
thousand
years
behaved
like
a
sentient
thing
at
first
of
course
her
actions
were
frenzied
almost
insane
as
if
the
disciplinary
circuit
waves
which
made
dona
a
statue
of
agony
and
kept
kim
frozen
with
contorted
muscles
could
affect
the
space
ship
too
wildly
the
little
vessel
went
upward
through
air
which
screamed
as
it
parted
for
her
passage
she
yawed
and
swayed
and
ludicrously
plunged
backwards
the
screaming
of
the
air
rose
to
a
shriek
and
then
to
a
high
thin
whistle
and
then
ceased
altogether
finally
she
was
free
of
the
air
of
alphin
iii
after
this
she
really
made
speed
backing
away
from
the
planet
her
meteor
detectors
had
been
turned
on
in
one
of
kim
s
random
splicings
and
when
current
reached
them
they
reported
a
monstrous
obstruction
in
her
path
and
shunted
in
the
meteor
repelling
beams
the
obstacle
was
the
planet
itself
and
the
beams
tried
to
push
it
away
naturally
they
pushed
the
ship
itself
away
out
into
the
huge
chasm
of
interplanetary
space
it
kept
up
for
a
long
time
too
because
kim
was
paralyzed
by
the
broadcast
waves
they
were
kept
focused
upon
him
by
the
psychographic
locator
so
long
as
those
waves
of
the
disciplinary
circuit
came
up
through
the
ionosphere
kim
s
spasmodically
contracted
muscles
kept
together
the
two
cables
which
had
started
everything
but
the
starshine
backed
away
at
four
gravities
acceleration
faster
and
ever
faster
and
ordinary
psychographic
locators
are
not
designed
for
use
beyond
planetary
distances
ultimately
the
tormenting
radio
beam
lessened
from
sheer
distance
at
last
the
influence
broke
off
suddenly
and
kim
s
hands
on
the
leads
dropped
away
the
beam
fumbled
back
to
contact
and
wavered
away
again
and
presently
was
only
a
tingling
sensation
probing
for
a
target
the
locators
could
no
longer
keep
lined
up
then
the
starshine
seemed
to
lose
her
frenzy
and
become
merely
a
derelict
she
sped
on
giving
no
sign
of
life
for
a
time
then
her
vision
ports
glowed
abruptly
kim
rendell
working
desperately
against
time
and
with
the
chill
of
outer
space
creeping
into
the
ship
s
unpowered
hull
had
found
a
severed
cable
which
supplied
light
and
heat
an
hour
later
still
the
ship
steadied
in
her
motion
he
had
traced
down
the
gyros
power
lead
and
set
them
to
work
two
hours
later
yet
the
starshine
paused
in
her
flight
her
long
pointed
nose
turned
about
a
new
element
of
motion
entered
the
picture
she
made
she
changed
course
at
last
as
if
having
her
drive
finally
in
operation
gave
her
something
of
purposefulness
the
slim
space
ship
ceased
to
look
frenzied
or
frowsy
or
bemused
and
swam
through
space
with
a
serene
competence
like
something
very
much
alive
and
knowing
exactly
what
she
was
about
she
came
to
rest
upon
the
almost
but
not
quite
airless
bulk
of
alphin
ii
some
thirty
hours
after
her
escape
from
alphin
iii
kim
was
desperately
hungry
but
for
the
lesser
gravity
of
the
smaller
inner
planet
which
was
responsible
for
its
thinned
out
atmosphere
he
might
have
staggered
as
he
walked
certainly
a
normal
space
suit
would
have
been
a
heavy
burden
for
a
man
who
had
starved
for
days
dona
also
looked
pale
and
worn
out
when
she
took
from
him
the
things
he
brought
back
through
the
airlock
they
put
the
great
masses
of
spongy
woody
stuff
in
the
synthesizer
it
was
organic
matter
some
of
it
perhaps
could
have
been
consumed
as
food
in
its
original
state
but
the
synthesizer
received
it
and
hummed
and
buzzed
quietly
to
itself
and
presently
the
man
and
woman
ate
the
synthesizer
was
not
the
equivalent
of
those
magnificently
complex
food
machines
which
in
public
dining
halls
provide
almost
every
dish
the
gourmets
have
ever
invented
from
raw
materials
but
it
did
make
a
palatable
meal
from
the
tasteless
vegetation
of
the
small
planet
kim
said
quietly
when
they
had
finished
eating
now
we
ll
find
out
for
certain
what
burt
intends
to
do
about
us
he
grimaced
he
s
dangerously
intelligent
he
underestimated
me
before
he
may
consider
us
dead
or
he
may
overestimate
us
i
think
he
ll
play
it
safe
i
would
in
his
place
what
does
that
mean
dona
asked
wistfully
we
will
be
able
to
go
to
some
other

kim
as
if
we
d
gone
in
the

transmitter
in
a
perfectly
normal
fashion
simply
to
take
up
residence
on
another
world
kim
shook
his
head
i
m
beginning
to
doubt
it
he
said
slowly
the
discovery
that
with
a
bit
of
hafnium
a
man
can
change
his
psychographic
pattern
is
high
explosive
if
the
disciplinary
circuit
can
t
pick
him
out
as
an
individual
any
man
can
defy
any
government
which
depends
on
the
circuit
which
means
that
no
government
is
safe
i
ve
got
to
remove
you
for
the
sake
of
the
government
everywhere
in
the
galaxy
but
they
can
t
touch
us
here
said
dona
we
re
safe
now
kim
shook
his
head
no
i
was
too
hungry
to
think
before
we
re
not
safe
i
ve
got
to
work
like
the
devil
do
you
remember
your
galactic
history
remember
what
the
disciplinary
circuit
was
built
up
to
remember
the
last
war
it
s
not
only
the
space
ships
which
went
into
museums
i
m
suddenly
scared
stiff
he
stood
up
and
abruptly
began
to
put
on
the
space
suit
again
his
face
had
become
haggard
in
the
last
war
there
were
no
battles
only
massacres
he
said
curtly
as
he
snapped
buckles
there
was
no
victory
they
used
a
beam
which
was
a
stepped
up
version
of
the
disciplinary
circuit
they
called
it
a
fighting
beam
then
and
they
thought
they
could
fight
with
it
but
they
couldn
t
it
simply
made
war
impossible
so
ultimately
they
hooded
over
the
projectors
of
the
fighting
beams
and
most
of
them
probably
fell
to
rust
but
there
are
some
in
the
museums
if
burt
and
the
others
want
to
play
safe
they
ll
haul
those
projectors
out
of
the
museum
and
hook
them
up
to
find
and
kill
us
and
there
s
no
question
but
that
they
can
do
it
he
stepped
into
the
airlock
and
closed
the
door
still
fumbling
with
the
last
adjustments
to
his
space
suit
dona
was
puzzled
by
his
gloomy
forebodings
she
heard
the
outer
door
open
as
she
stood
there
bewildered
she
heard
him
bringing
more
raw
food
stuff
to
the
airlock
with
a
feverish
haste
he
made
two
trips
three
and
four
she
found
herself
screaming
shrilly
because
of
an
agony
already
past
it
had
been
a
bare
flash
of
pain
it
was
gone
in
the
fraction
of
a
second
in
the
fraction
of
a
millisecond
but
it
was
such
pain
it
was
the
anguish
of
the
disciplinary
circuit
a
thousand
times
multiplied
it
was
such
torment
as
the
ancients
tried
vainly
to
picture
as
the
lot
of
damned
souls
in
hell
had
it
lasted
any
living
creature
would
have
died
of
sheer
suffering
but
it
flashed
into
being
and
was
gone
and
dona
had
cried
out
in
a
strangled
voice
she
was
filled
with
a
horrible
weakness
from
the
one
instant
of
anguish
and
she
felt
stark
panic
lest
it
come
again

outer
airlock

slammed
shut

came
staggering
within
he
did

up

said
as
hoarsely
as
before
they
re
searching
for
us
we
were
so
far
away
that
the
beam
flashed
past
it
won
t
record

us
for
minutes

take

touch

occasionally

get
out
of

the
starshine
swung
about
in
space
the
brutal
acceleration
began
again
at
an
angle
to
the
former
line
of
motion
ten
minutes
later
there
was
another
moment
of
intolerable
pain
every
nerve
in
their
bodies
jumped
in
a
tetanic
convulsion
had
it
continued
their
muscles
would
have
torn
loose
from
their
bones
and
their
hearts
would
have
burst
from
the
violence
of
the
fearful
contraction
the
starshine
would
have
gone
on
senselessly
as
a
speeding
coffin
but
again
the
searing
torment

quaint

in
appearance

a
thousand
years
before

had
been
the
final

in

they
represented
an

forth
tight

the

a

did
not
cease
to
fight
when
its
crew
was
dead
and
every
crew
had
died
when
a
fighting
beam
lingered
briefly
on
their
ship
there
was
not
one
single
survivor
of
the
battle
of
canis
major
the
fleets
plunged
at
each
other
and
every
living
thing
in
both
fleets
had
perished
instantly
thereafter
the
empty
ships
fought
on
as
robots
against
all
other
ships
so
there
were
no
more
wars
for
two
hundred
years
after
that
battle
the
planets
of
the
galaxy
continued
to
mount
their
projectors
and
keep
their
detector
screens
out
but
war
had
defeated
itself
there
could
be
no
victories
but
only
joint
suicides
there
could
be
no
conquests
because
even
a
depopulated
planet
s
projectors
would
still
destroy
all
life
in
any
approaching
space
ship
for
as
many
years
as
the
projectors
were
powered
for
but
in
time
more
especially
after
matter
transmitters
had
made
space
craft
useless
they
were
forgotten
all
but
those
which
went
into
museums
for
the
instruction
of
the
young
these
resuscitated
weapons
were
now
at
work
to
find
and
kill
kim
and
dona
in
a
sense
it
was
like
trying
to
kill
flies
with
a
sixteen
inch
gun
the
difficulties
of
aiming
were
extreme
to
set
up
a
detector
field
and
neutralize
it
would
take
time
and
skill
which
were
not
available
so
the
beams
swept
through
great
arcs
with
operators
watching
for
signs
of
contact
it
was
long
minutes
after
the
first
contact
before
the
instruments
on
the
projectors
recorded
it
because
the
news
could
only
go
back
at
the
speed
of
light
then
the
projectors
had
to
retrace
their
path
and
the
starshine
had
moved
the
beams
had
to
fumble
blindly
for
the
fugitives
and
they
told
of
each
touch
but
only
after
it
occurred
and
kim
struggled
to
make
his
course
unpredictable
in
ten
hours
the
beam
struck
four
times
only
because
kim
changed
course
and
acceleration
so
fiercely
and
so
frequently
that
a
contact
could
only
be
a
matter
of
chance
then
for
a
long
time
there
was
no
touch
at
all
in
two
days
alphin
the
sun
had
dwindled
until
it
was
merely
the
brightest
of
the
stars
with
a
barely
perceptible
disk
on
the
third
day
the
beam
found
them
yet
again
and
dona
burst
into
hysterical
sobs
but
it
was
not
really
bad
this
time
there
is
a
limit
to
the
distance
to
which
a
tight
beam
can
be
held
together
in
space
by
technicians
who
have
no
space
experience
and
instinctive
know
how
within
hours
after
this
fifth
contact
kim
rendell
found
the
last
key
break
in
the
control
cables
of
the
ship
and
was
able
to
throw
on
the
overdrive
by
which
the
starshine
fled
from
alphin
at
two
hundred
times
the
speed
of
light
then
of
course
they
were
safe
even
had
the
beam
of
agony
been
trained
directly
upon
the
ship
it
could
not
have
overtaken
them
but
dona
was
a
bundle
of
shrinking
nerves
when
it
was
over
and
kim
raged
as
he
looked
at
her
scared
eyes
i
know
she
said
unsteadily
when
he
had
her
in
the
control
room
to
look
at
the
cosmos
as
it
appeared
at
faster
than
light
speed
i
know
i
m
silly
kim
it
can
t
hurt
us
any
more
we
re
going
to
another
solar
system
entirely
they
won
t
know
anything
about
us
we
re
all
right
quite
all
right
but
i
m
just
all
in
little
pieces
with
somber
brow
kim
stared
at
the
vision
plates
about
him
the
universe
as
seen
at
two
hundred
light
speeds
was
not
a
reassuring
sight
all
stars
behind
had
vanished
all
those
on
either
hand
were
dimmed
to
near
invisibility
ahead
where
the
very
nose
of
the
space
ship
pointed
there
were
specks
of
light
in
a
recognizable
star
pattern
but
the
colors
and
the
magnitudes
were
incredible
we
re
heading
now
for
cetis
alpha
kim
said
slowly
after
a
long
time
it
s
the
next
nearest
solar
system
our
fuel
tanks
are
one
twelfth
full
we
have
power
to
travel
a
distance
of
fifty
light
years
no
more
and
it
would
take
us
three
months
to
cover
that
cetis
alpha
is
seven
light
years
away
or
it
was
we
re
going
to
settle
on
one
of
the
planets
there
dona
asked
hopefully
what
are
they
like
kim
you
might
look
them
up
in
the
pilot
kim
said
rather
glumly
there
are
six
inhabited
ones
you
sound
worried
she
said
what
is
it
i
m
wondering
kim
admitted
if
burt
and
the
prime
board
should
send
word
ahead
of
us
by
matter
transmitter
to
these
six
planets
and
all
the
other
inhabited
planets
within
fifty
or
a
hundred
light
years
it
would
be
awkward
for
us
transmission
by
matter
transmitter
is
instantaneous
and
it
wouldn
t
take
too
long
for
the
governments
on
the
cetis
alpha
planets
to
set
up
detectors
and
remount
the
projectors
which
could
kill
us
burt
would
call
us
very
dangerous
criminals
he
d
say
we
were
so
dangerous
we
had
better
be
killed
before
we
land
he
paused
and
added
he
s
right
i
don
t
see
why
they
should
do
anything
so
cruel
we
ve
struck
at
the
foundation
of
government
kim
said
savagely
on
alphin
three
there
s
a
pretense
that
all
men
are
free
and
we
know
it
s
a
lie
but
on
the
other
planets
they
don
t
even
pretend
on
lor
four
they
have
a
king
on
markab
two
the
citizens
wear
collars
of
metal
slave
collars
and
members
of
the
aristocracy
have
the
right
to
murder
social
inferiors
at
pleasure
on
andrometa
nine
the
disciplinary
circuit
and
so
the
government
is
in
the
hands
of
a
blood
thirsty
lunatic
the
circuit
backs
all
governments
alike
the
supposedly
free
and
the
frankly
despotic
governments
impartially
we
re
a
danger
to
all
of
them
even
a
decent
government
if
there
is
one
would
dread
having
its
citizens
able
to
defy
the
circuit
yet
in
ten
words
i
can
tell
how
to
nullify
the
one
instrument
on
which
all
government
is
based
once
that
knowledge
gets
loose
nothing
can
suppress
it
dona
sighed
i
was
hoping
we
could
go
some
place
where
we
would
be
safe
she
said
isn
t
there
any
such
place
kim
s
laugh
was
bitter
i
wonder
if
there
s
any
place
where
we
can
be
free
he
said
i
planned
big
dona
but
it
didn
t
work
out
there
wasn
t
another
man
on
alphin
three
who
wanted
to
be
free
as
much
as
i
did
i
d
about
decided
that
just
the
two
of
us
would
put
on
protectors
and
journey
from
one
planet
to
another
in
search
of
freedom
but
then
burt
saw
you
and
you
were
locked
up
so
you
d
go
frantic
with
fear
and
loneliness
later
they
d
have
given
you
a
psychological
conditioning
to
cure
you
of
terror
and
sent
you
away
to
burt
s
pleasure
palace
why
didn
t
you
take
me
away
before
burt
saw
me
she
asked
why
did
you
wait
kim
groaned
because
i
wasn
t
ready
when
i
realized
the
danger
i
tried
to
get
you
and
i
was
caught
they
found
out
what
i
had
and
everything
became
hopeless
they
put
me
on
block
to
see
if
anyone
would
try
to
befriend
me
but
i
hadn
t
any
friends
i
didn
t
know
anyone
else
who
wouldn
t
have
been
frightened
if
i
d
told
him
he
was
a
slave
i
threatened
the
prime
board
with
a
broadcast
but
i
m
afraid
nobody
would
have
believed
me
it
all
happened
because
of
me
dona
said
forget
what
i
said
about
wanting
to
be
safe
kim
i
don
t
care
any
more
not
if
i
m
with
you
kim
scowled
at
the
weird
pattern
of
strangely
colored
stars
upon
the
vision
plate
we
re
using
a
lot
of
our
fuel
in
trying
for
cetis
alpha
s
planets
i
d
like
to
well
have
a
marriage
ceremony
despite
her
anxiety
dona
burst
out
laughing
it
s
about
time
you
big
lug
she
cried
i
was
beginning
to
lose
hope
kim
laughed
too
all
right
i
ll
see
if
it
can
be
managed
but
if
warnings
have
been
sent
ahead
of
us
marriage
may
be
difficult
outcasts
of
space
like
a
silver
arrow
the
starshine
continued
to
bore
on
through
a
weird
synthetic
universe
two
hundred
times
faster
than
light
in
the
space
ship
kim
worked
angrily
making
desperate
attempts
to
devise
a
method
of
nullifying
the
non
individualized
fighting
beams
with
which
now
that
he
was
in
free
space
in
a
space
ship
any
attempt
to
land
upon
an
inhabited
planet
might
be
frustrated
in
the
end
he
constructed
two
small
wristlets
one
for
himself
and
one
for
dona
to
wear
if
tuned
waves
of
the
circuit
struck
them
the
wristlets
might
nullify
them
but
if
the
fighting
beams
struck
that
would
be
another
story
twelve
days
after
turning
on
the
overdrive
which
by
changing
the
constants
of
space
about
the
space
ship
made
two
hundred
light
speeds
possible
kim
turned
it
off
he
had
previously
assured
himself
that
dona
was
wearing
the
little
gadget
he
had
built
as
he
snapped
off
the
overdrive
field
the
look
of
the
universe
changed
with
a
startling
suddenness
stars
leaped
into
being
on
every
side
amazingly
bright
and
astoundingly
varicolored
cetis
alpha
loomed
almost
dead
ahead
a
glaring
globe
of
fire
with
enormous
streamers
streaming
out
on
every
side
there
were
planets
too
as
the
starshine
jogged
on
at
a
normal
interplanetary
rather
than
interstellar
speed
dona
focused
the
electron
telescope
upon
the
nearest
it
was
a
great
round
disk
with
polar
ice
caps
and
extraordinarily
interconnected
seas
so
that
there
were
innumerable
small
continents
distributed
everywhere
green
vegetation
showed
and
patches
of
cloud
and
when
dona
turned
the
magnification
up
to
its
very
peak
they
were
certain
that
they
saw
the
pattern
of
a
magnificent
metropolis
she
looked
at
it
hungrily
kim
regarded
it
steadily
they
did
not
speak
for
a
long
time
it
would
be
nice
there
dona
said
longingly
at
last
do
you
think
we
can
land
kim
we
re
going
to
try
he
told
her
but
they
didn
t
they
were
forty
million
miles
away
when
a
sudden
overwhelming
anguish
smote
them
both
all
the
universe
ceased
to
be
six
weeks
later
kim
rendell
eased
the
starshine
to
a
landing
on
the
solitary
satellite
of
the
red
dwarf
sun
phanis
it
was
about
four
thousand
miles
in
diameter
its
atmosphere
was
about
one
fourth
the
density
needed
to
support
human
life
such
vegetation
as
it
possessed
was
stunted
and
lichenous
the
terrain
was
tumbled
and
upheaved
with
raw
rock
showing
in
great
masses
which
had
apparently
solidified
in
a
condition
of
frenzied
turmoil
it
had
been
examined
and
dismissed
as
useless
for
human
colonization
many
centuries
since
that
was
why
kim
and
dona
could
land
upon
it
they
had
spent
half
their
store
of
fuel
in
the
desperate
effort
to
find
a
planet
on
which
they
could
land
their
attempt
to
approach
cetis
alpha
vi
had
been
the
exact
type
of
all
their
fruitless
efforts
they
came
in
for
a
landing
and
while
yet
millions
of
miles
out
recently
reinstalled
detector
screens
searched
them
out
newly
stepped
up
long
distance
psychographic
finders
had
identified
the
starshine
as
containing
living
human
beings
then
projectors
taken
out
of
museums
had
hurled
at
them
the
deadly
pain
beams
which
had
made
war
futile
a
thousand
years
before
they
might
have
died
within
one
second
from
the
bursting
of
their
hearts
and
the
convulsive
rupture
of
every
muscular
anchorage
to
every
bone
except
for
one
thing
kim
s
contrived
wristlets
had
saved
them
the
wristlets
plus
a
relay
on
a
set
of
controls
to
throw
the
starshine
into
overdrive
travel
through
space
the
wristlets
contained
a
morsel
of
hafnium
so
that
any
previous
psychographic
record
of
them
as
individuals
would
no
longer
check
with
the
psychogram
a
searchbeam
would
encounter
but
also
on
the
first
instant
of
convulsive
contraction
of
muscles
beneath
the
wristlets
they
emitted
a
frantic
tiny
signal
that
signal
kicked
over
the
control
relay
the
starshine
flung
itself
into
overdrive
escape
faster
than
light
faster
than
the
pain
beams
could
follow
they
had
suffered
of
course
horribly
but
the
pain
beams
could
not
play
upon
them
or
more
than
the
tenth
of
a
millisecond
before
the
starshine
vanished
into
faster
than
light
escape
they
had
tried
each
of
the
six
planets
of
cetis
alpha
they
had
gone
rather
desperately
to
cetis
gamma
with
four
inhabited
planets
and
sorene
with
three
then
the
inroads
on
their
scant
fuel
supply
and
their
dwindling
store
of
vegetation
from
alphin
ii
made
them
accept
defeat
the
massed
volumes
of
the
galactic
pilot
for
this
sector
age
yellowed
brittle
volumes
now
had
told
them
of
vegetation
on
the
useless
planet
of
the
dwarf
star
phanis
they
came
to
it
kim
was
stunned
and
bitter
and
they
landed
after
the
ship
had
settled
down
in
a
weird
valley
with
fantastic
overhanging
cliffs
and
a
frozen
small
waterfall
nearby
the
two
of
them
went
outside
they
wore
space
suits
of
course
because
of
the
extreme
thinness
of
the
air
i
suppose
we
can
call
this
home
now
kim
said
bitterly
it
was
night
the
sky
was
cloudless
and
all
the
stars
of
the
galaxy
looked
down
upon
them
as
they
stood
in
the
biting
cold
his
voice
went
by
space
phone
to
the
helmet
of
dona
by
his
side
i
guess
i
can
stand
it
if
you
can
kim
she
said
quietly
we
ve
got
fuel
for
six
weeks
drive
he
said
ironically
that
means
we
can
go
to
any
place
within
twenty
five
light
years
we
ve
tried
every
solar
system
in
that
range
they
re
all
warned
against
us
they
all
had
their
projectors
in
operation
we
couldn
t
land
and
we
d
have
starved
unless
we
got
to
some
new
material
for
the
synthesizer
this
was
the
only
place
we
could
land
on
so
we
have
to
stand
it
if
we
stand
anything
dona
was
silent
for
a
little
while
we
ve
got
each
other
kim
she
said
slowly
for
a
limited
time
he
said
if
we
use
our
fuel
only
for
heat
and
to
run
the
synthesizer
for
food
it
will
probably
last
several
years
but
ultimately
it
will
run
out
and
we
ll
die
are
you
sorry
you
threw
away
everything
for
me
kim
asked
dona
i
m
not
sorry
i
m
with
you
i
d
rather
be
with
you
for
a
little
while
and
then
die
certainly
death
is
better
than
what
i
faced
kim
made
a
furious
gesture
it
s
recognized
everywhere
that
the
population
of
a
planet
has
the
right
to
make
all
the
laws
of
that
planet
we
are
the
population
here
we
could
be
married
by
our
own
act
but
suppose
we
had
children
when
our
fuel
gives
out
they
d
die
with
us
i
think
we
d
go
mad
anticipating
that
we
can
t
even
have
each
other
we
re
imprisoned
here
as
they
used
to
imprison
criminals
for
life
we
can
have
no
hope
there
is
nothing
we
can
work
at
we
can
t
even
try
to
do
anything
he
clenched
his
hands
inside
his
space
gloves
dona
looked
at
him
are
you
going
to
give
up
kim
give
up
what
then
he
said
bitterly
no
dona
i
m
going
to
find
some
excuse
for
hoping
some
lie
i
can
tell
myself
but
i
ll
know
i
m
simply
trying
to
deceive
myself
there
was
a
long
silence
hopelessness
futility
i
ve
been
thinking
kim
dona
said
softly
at
last
there
are
three
hundred
million
inhabited
planets
there
are
trillions
and
quintillions
of
people
in
the
galaxy
if
they
knew
about
us
some
of
them
at
least
would
want
to
help
us
there
are
some
probably
who
d
hope
we
could
help
them
if
we
were
to
think
of
a
new
approach
to
the
problem
we
face
and
reach
the
people
who
would
want
to
help
us
it
might
mean
eventual
rescue
signals
travel
at
the
speed
of
light
kim
said
we
d
be
dead
long
before
even
a
tight
beam
signal
could
reach
another
star
cluster
if
there
were
anybody
there
to
receive
or
act
on
it
but
there
aren
t
any
space
ships
except
the
starshine
it
was
the
last
ship
used
in
the
galaxy
dona
said
stoutly
we
ve
been
regarding
our
predicament
as
if
it
were
unique
as
if
nobody
else
in
the
universe
wanted
to
be
free
as
if
there
was
only
one
problem
ours
i
heard
a
story
once
kim
it
was
about
a
man
who
had
to
carry
a
certain
particular
grain
of
dust
to
another
place
a
silly
story
of
course
but
this
was
the
top
grain
in
a
dust
pile
the
man
tried
to
find
something
that
would
pick
up
the
one
grain
of
dust
and
something
that
would
hold
it
quite
safe
but
he
couldn
t
solve
the
problem
there
wasn
t
any
box
that
would
hold
a
single
grain
of
dust
he
couldn
t
even
pick
up
a
solitary
dust
grain
and
how
could
he
carry
it
if
he
couldn
t
pick
it
up
that
s
a
fable
kim
said
harshly
there
s
a
moral
dona
smiled
yes
she
said
there
is
he
picked
up
the
dust
grain
with
a
shovel
he
picked
up
a
lot
of
others
too
but
that
didn
t
matter
and
he
could
find
a
box
to
hold
a
hundred
thousand
dust
grains
when
he
couldn
t
find
a
box
to
hold
one
kim
was
silent
dona
nodded
and
smiled
at
him
if
you
want
a
new
way
to
think
how
about
thinking
not
just
of
us
and
our
problem
but
the
problem
of
all
the
people
like
us
who
have
gone
into
revolt
she
said
how
about
all
the
people
who
ve
been
sent
to
ades
how
about
all
those
who
will
go
in
years
to
come
i
don
t
know
the
answer
kim
but
it
s
another
way
to
think
since
we
ve
failed
to
solve
a
little
problem
by
itself
suppose
we
look
at
it
as
part
of
a
big
one
it
s
a
new
approach
anyhow
there
was
silence
the
bright
many
colored
stars
overhead
moved
perceptibly
toward
what
would
be
called
the
west
by
age
old
custom
weird
shapes
of
frozen
rock
loomed
above
the
space
ship
and
the
starlight
glimmered
up
on
thin
hoarfrost
which
settled
everywhere
upon
this
small
planet
in
the
dark
hours
kim
stirred
suddenly
and
was
still
again
dona
continued
to
watch
him
she
could
not
see
his
face
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
stood
straighter
somehow
then
suddenly
he
spoke
gruffly
let
s
go
back
in
the
ship
he
said
space
suits
are
admirable
inventions
dona
but
they
have
limitations
i
can
t
kiss
you
through
a
space
helmet
he
did
not
wait
until
they
were
out
of
the
airlock
and
she
clung
to
him
then
he
grinned
for
the
first
time
in
many
days
my
dear
he
said
contentedly
not
only
are
you
the
best
looking
female
i
ever
saw
but
you
ve
got
brains
now
watch
me
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
breathlessly
too
much
to
waste
time
talking
about
it
he
told
her
want
to
help
look
up
ades
in
the
pilot
i
had
completely
forgotten
i
was
a
matter
transmitter
technician
he
kissed
her
again
exuberantly
and
strode
for
the
starshine
record
room
shedding
the
parts
of
his
space
suit
as
he
went
he
pulled
down
the
microfilm
reels
covering
the
ship
s
construction
and
zestfully
set
to
work
to
review
them
making
notes
and
sketches
from
time
to
time
the
reels
of
course
contained
not
only
the
complete
working
drawings
of
the
entire
ship
showing
every
bolt
and
rivet
but
also
every
moving
part
in
stereoscopic
relationship
to
its
fellows
with
full
data
so
that
no
possible
breakdown
could
take
place
without
full
information
being
available
for
its
repair
dona
watched
him
furtively
as
she
began
the
tedious
task
of
hunting
through
the
galactic
pilot
of
this
sector
two
hundred
odd
volumes
for
even
a
stray
reference
to
the
planet
ades
ultimately
she
did
find
ades
mentioned
not
in
the
bound
volumes
of
the
pilot
but
in
the
microfilm
abbreviated
galactic
directory
ades
rated
just
three
lines
of
type
its
space
co
rdinates
the
spectral
type
of
its
sun
a
climate
atmosphere
symbol
which
indicated
that
three
fourths
of
its
surface
experienced
sub
arctic
conditions
and
the
memo
its
borderline
habitability
caused
it
to
be
chosen
as
a
penal
colony
at
a
very
early
date
landing
upon
it
is
forbidden
under
all
circumstances
a
patrol
ship
is
on
guard
the
memorandum
was
quaint
now
that
no
space
line
had
operated
in
five
centuries
no
exploring
ship
in
nearly
two
and
the
space
patrol
itself
had
been
disbanded
three
hundred
years
since
mmmm
kim
said
if
we
need
it
not
too
bad
people
could
survive
on
ades
people
probably
have
and
they
won
t
be
sheep
anyhow
how
far
away
is
it
dona
asked
uneasily
we
have
enough
fuel
for
twenty
five
light
years
travel
you
said
ades
is
just
about
halfway
across
the
galaxy
he
told
her
we
couldn
t
really
get
started
there
if
our
tanks
were
full
the
only
way
to
reach
it
is
by
matter
transmitter
but
he
did
not
look
disheartened
dona
watch
his
face
it
s
ruled
out
what
did
you
hope
from
it
kim
a
wedding
he
said
and
grinned
but
it
isn
t
ruled
out
dona
nothing
s
ruled
out
if
an
idea
you
gave
me
works
your
story
about
the
dust
grain
hit
my
mind
just
right
i
was
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
travel
a
hundred
light
years
on
twenty
five
light
years
fuel
even
though
the
prime
board
may
have
sent
warnings
three
times
that
far
but
if
you
can
t
solve
a
little
problem
make
it
a
big
one
and
tackle
that
that
s
what
your
story
meant
it
s
a
nice
trick
super
science
dona
was
puzzled
by
what
kim
had
said
she
stared
at
him
wide
eyed
trying
to
figure
out
his
meaning
for
a
moment
or
two
he
made
no
attempt
to
explain
he
just
stood
there
grinning
at
her
listen
dona
he
said
finally
why
did
they
stop
making
space
ships
matter
transmitters
are
quicker
and
space
ships
aren
t
needed
any
more
right
kim
said
but
why
was
the
starshine
used
by
my
revered
great
grandfather
to
bring
the
first
colonists
to
alphin
three
because
well
because
you
have
to
have
a
receiver
for
a
matter
transmitter
and
you
have
to
carry
it
alphin
three
was
almost
the
last
planet
in
the
galaxy
to
be
colonized
wasn
t
it
yes
why
do
you
have
to
carry
a
receiver
no
don
t
bother
but
do
answer
this
one
if
two
places
are
both
too
far
to
get
to
what
s
the
difference
why
none
oh
there
s
a
lot
he
told
her
the
next
star
cluster
is
too
far
away
for
the
starshine
with
her
present
drive
and
fuel
to
the
next
galaxy
is
no
farther
but
when
i
stopped
trying
to
think
of
ways
to
stretch
our
fuel
and
started
trying
to
think
of
a
way
to
get
to
the
next
galaxy
i
got
it
she
stared
are
we
going
there
to
live
she
said
submissively
but
her
eyes
were
sparkling
with
mirth
he
kissed
her
exuberantly
my
dear
i
wouldn
t
put
anything
past
the
two
of
us
together
but
let
me
show
you
how
it
works
he
spread
out
the
drawings
he
had
made
from
the
construction
records
while
she
searched
the
pilot
he
expounded
their
meaning
enthusiastically
and
she
listened
and
made
admiring
comments
but
it
is
rather
doubtful
if
she
really
understood
she
was
too
much
occupied
with
the
happy
knowledge
that
he
was
again
confident
and
hopeful
but
the
idea
was
not
particularly
complicated
every
fact
was
familiar
enough
space
ships
in
the
old
days
and
the
starshine
in
this
were
able
to
exceed
the
speed
of
light
by
enclosing
themselves
in
an
overdrive
field
which
was
space
so
stressed
that
in
it
the
velocity
of
light
was
enormously
increased
therefore
the
inertia
of
matter
its
resistance
to
acceleration
or
its
mass
was
reduced
by
the
same
factor
y
the
kinetic
energy
of
a
moving
space
ship
of
course
had
to
remain
the
same
when
an
overdrive
field
was
formed
about
it
thus
when
its
inertia
was
decreased
by
the
field
its
velocity
had
to
increase
mathematically
the
relationship
of
mass
to
velocity
with
a
given
quantity
of
kinetic
energy
is
for
normal
space
mv
e
in
an
overdrive
field
where
the
factor
y
enters
the
equation
is
m
y
yv
e
the
value
of
y
is
such
that
speeds
up
to
two
hundred
times
that
of
light
result
from
a
space
ship
at
normal
interplanetary
speed
going
into
an
overdrive
field
a
matter
transmitter
field
as
everyone
knows
now
simply
raises
the
value
of
y
to
infinity
the
formula
then
becomes
m
infinity
infinity
v
e
the
mass
is
divided
by
infinity
and
the
velocity
multiplied
by
infinity
the
velocity
in
a
planet
to
planet
transmitter
is
always
directly
toward
the
receiver
to
which
the
transmitter
is
tuned
in
theory
then
a
man
who
enters
such
a
transmitter
passes
through
empty
space
unprotected
but
his
exposure
is
so
exceedingly
brief
across
the
whole
first
galaxy
transit
was
estimated
to
require
second
that
not
one
molecule
of
the
air
surrounding
him
has
time
to
escape
into
emptiness
thus
the
one
device
is
simply
an
extension
of
the
principle
of
the
other
a
matter
transmitter
is
merely
an
enormously
developed
overdrive
field
generator
with
a
tuning
device
attached
but
until
this
moment
apparently
it
had
not
happened
that
a
matter
transmitter
technician
was
in
a
predicament
where
the
only
way
out
was
to
put
those
facts
together
kim
was
such
a
technician
and
on
the
starshine
he
had
probably
the
only
overdrive
field
generator
of
space
ship
pattern
still
in
working
order
in
the
universe
all
i
ve
got
to
do
is
to
add
two
stages
of
coupling
and
rewind
the
exciter
secondary
he
told
her
zestfully
doing
it
by
hand
may
take
a
week
then
the
starshine
will
be
a
matter
transmitter
which
will
transmit
itself
the
toughest
part
of
the
whole
job
will
be
the
distance
gauge
and
i
ve
got
that
worshipfully
dona
looked
up
at
him
she
probably
hoped
that
he
would
kiss
her
again
but
he
mistook
it
for
interest
he
explained
at
length
there
could
be
of
course
no
measure
of
distance
traveled
in
emptiness
astrogation
has
always
been
a
matter
of
dead
reckoning
plus
direct
observation
but
at
such
immeasurably
high
speeds
there
could
be
no
direct
observation
at
matter
transmitter
speeds
no
manual
control
could
stop
a
ship
in
motion
within
any
given
galaxy
so
kim
had
planned
a
photo
gauge
which
would
throw
off
the
transmitter
field
when
a
specific
amount
of
radiation
had
reached
it
at
thousands
of
light
speeds
the
radiation
impinging
on
the
bow
of
a
ship
would
equal
in
seconds
the
normal
reception
of
years
when
a
specific
total
of
radiation
had
struck
it
a
relay
would
cut
off
the
drive
field
among
other
features
such
a
control
would
make
it
impossible
for
a
speeding
ship
to
venture
too
close
to
a
sun
kim
set
joyously
to
work
to
make
three
changes
in
the
overdrive
circuit
and
to
build
a
radiation
operated
relay
outside
the
space
ship
the
sky
turned
deep
purple
presently
the
dull
red
sun
arose
and
the
white
hoarfrost
melted
and
glistened
wetly
and
most
of
it
evaporated
in
a
thin
white
mist
the
frozen
waterfall
dripped
and
dripped
and
presently
flowed
freely
the
lichenous
plants
rippled
and
stirred
in
the
thin
chill
winds
that
blew
over
the
small
planet
and
even
animals
appeared
stupid
and
sluggish
things
which
lived
upon
the
lichens
hours
passed
the
dull
red
sun
sank
low
and
vanished
the
little
waterfall
flowed
more
and
more
slowly
and
at
last
ceased
altogether
the
sky
became
a
deep
dense
black
and
multitudes
of
stars
shone
down
on
the
grounded
space
ship
it
was
a
small
starved
world
this
planet
swinging
in
lonely
isolation
around
a
burned
out
sun
about
it
lay
the
galaxy
in
which
were
three
hundred
million
inhabited
worlds
circling
brighter
hotter
much
more
splendid
stars
but
the
starveling
little
planet
was
the
only
place
in
all
the
galaxy
save
one
where
no
disciplinary
circuit
held
the
human
race
in
slavery
nothing
happened
visibly
upon
the
planet
during
many
days
there
were
nights
in
which
the
hoarfrost
glistened
whitely
and
days
in
which
the
frozen
waterfall
thawed
and
splashed
valiantly
the
sluggish
stupid
animals
ignored
the
space
ship
it
was
motionless
and
they
took
it
for
a
rock
only
twice
did
its
two
occupants
emerge
to
gather
the
vegetation
which
was
raw
material
for
their
food
synthesizer
on
the
second
expedition
kim
seized
upon
an
animal
to
add
to
the
larder
but
its
helpless
futile
struggles
somehow
disgusted
him
he
let
it
go
i
prefer
test
tube
meat
he
said
distastefully
we
ve
food
enough
anyhow
for
a
long
long
time
at
worst
we
can
always
come
back
for
more
they
went
into
the
ship
and
stored
the
vegetable
matter
in
the
synthesizer
bins
they
returned
then
to
the
control
room
i
think
it
s
right
kim
said
soberly
as
he
took
the
seat
before
the
control
panel
but
nobody
ever
knows
maybe
we
have
a
space
ship
now
which
makes
matter
transmitters
absurd
maybe
we
ve
something
we
can
t
control
at
all
which
will
land
us
hundreds
of
millions
of
light
years
away
so
that
we
ll
never
be
able
to
find
even
this
galaxy
again
maybe
we
might
have
something
which
will
simply
kill
us
instantly

there

cut
off
the

and
the

which
strove
to
sheer
the

from

as
they
had
once
driven
it
backward
away
from

iii
he
touched
a

which
activated
the

which

turn
on

he
waited
expectant

the

was
no
more
than
ten
million

from
the

if
there
were
an

at

the

be
setting
up

out
at

kim
found
himself
almost
cringing
from
anticipation
of
the
unspeakable
agony
which
only
an

exposure
to
a

beam
involved
but
nothing
happened
they
watched
the

dona
trained
the
electron
telescope
upon
them
they
were
not
continuous
there
were
rifts

be
glimpsed
sometimes
clearly
and
sometimes
as
through

she
put
in
an
infra
red

and
stepped
up
the

the

of
the

came
into

on
the

screen
they
saw
cities
they
saw
patches
of

of
unvarying

only
be
cultivated

kim
said
quietly
we
must
have
gone
beyond

or
they
d
have
stabbed
at
us
before
now
but
we
ll
be
careful
i
think
we
d
better
sneak
in
on
the
night
side
we
ll
turn
on
the
communicator
by
the
way
we
may
get
some
idea
of
the
identity
of
this
sun
he
put
the
little
ship
into
a
power
orbit
slanting
steeply
inward
in
a
curve
which
would
make
contact
with
the
planet
s
atmosphere
just
beyond
the
sunset
line
he
watched
the
hull
thermometers
for
their
indications
they
touched
air
very
high
up
and
went
down
and
down
fumbling
and
cautious
the
vision
screens
were
blank
for
a
long
time
but
the

told
of
solidity
two
hundred

below
then
one
hundred
then
fifty
twenty
five
ten
suddenly
the

speaker
spoke
in
a
gabble
of
confusing
voices
dona
tuned
it
down
to
one
all
the
galaxy
spoke
the
same
language
of
course
but
this
dialect
was
strangely
accented
presently
they
grew
accustomed
and
could
understand
we
all
take
pride
in
the
perfection
of
our
life
the
voice
said
unctuously
ten
thousand
years
ago
perfection
was
attained
upon
this
planet
and
it
is
for
us
to
maintain
that
perfection
unquestioningly
we
obey
our
rulers
because
obedience
is
a
part
of
perfection
sometimes
our
rulers
give
us
orders
which
to
all
appearances
are
severe
it
is
not
always
easy
to
obey
but
the
more
difficult
obedience
may
be
the
more
necessary
it
is
for
perfection
the
disciplinary
circuit
is
a
reminder
of
that
need
as
it
touches
us
once
each
day
to
spur
us
to
perfection
the
destruction
of
a
family
even
to
first
and
second
cousins
for
the
disobedience
of
a
single

is
necessary
that
every
seed
of
imperfection
shall
be
eliminated
from
our

quietly

she
obeyed
the
unctuous

somehow
the
air
of
ending
its

going

i
repeat
we
are
grateful
for
the
perfection

kim
turned
the

of

upward
the

drily
that

is
a

transmitter

itself
and
us
i
wasn

aware
of
any
interval
between
the
time
i
pressed
the
stud
and
the
time
the
altered
field
shut
off
but
we
came
almost
a
quarter
across
the
galaxy
it
was
horrible
dona
said
shivering
i
thought
alphin
three
was
bad
but
the
tyranny
here
is
ghastly
alphin
three
is
a
new
planet
kim
told
her
grimly
this
one
below
us
is
old
alphin
three
has
been
occupied
for
barely
two
hundred
years
its
people
have
relatively
the
vigor
and
the
sturdy
independence
of
pioneers
and
still
they
re
sheep
we
re
in
an
older
part
of
the
galaxy
now
and
the
race
back
here
has
grown
old
and
stupid
and
cruel
and
i
imagine
it
s
ready
to
die
he
bent
forward
and
made
a
careful
adjustment
of
the
light
operated
distance
gauge
he
cut
it
down
enormously
we
ll
try
it
again
he
said
he
pressed
the
stud
haven
at
last
an
increasing
sense
of
futility
and
depression
crept
over
kim
and
dona
during
the
next
few
days
they
visited
four
solar
systems
separated
by
distances
which
would
have
seemed
unthinkable
before
the
alteration
of
the
overdrive
there
was
no
longer
any
sensation
of
travel
because
no
distance
required
any
appreciable
period
of
time
once
indeed
kim
commented
curtly
on
the
danger
that
would
exist
if
they
went
too
close
to
the
galaxy
s
edge
with
only
the
amount
of
received
light
to
work
the
cut
out
switch
under
other
circumstances
they
might
have
plunged
completely
out
of
the
galaxy
and
to
unimaginable
distances
before
the
switch
could
have
acted
i
m
going
to
have
to
put
a
limiting
device
of
some
sort
on
this
thing
he
observed
with
a
limiting
device
the
transmitter
drive
can
t
stay
on
longer
than
a
few
micro
seconds
if
we
don
t
we
might
find
ourselves
lost
from
our
own
galaxy
and
unable
to
find
it
again
not
that
it
would
seem
to
matter
so
much
his
skepticism
seemed
justified
the
starshine
was
the
only
vessel
now
plying
among
the
stars
it
had
been
of
the
last
and
best
type
though
by
no
means
the
largest
ever
constructed
and
by
three
small
changes
in
its
overdrive
mechanism
kim
had
made
it
into
something
of
which
other
men
had
never
dreamed
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
human
race
other
galaxies
were
open
to
the
exploration
and
the
colonization
of
men
it
was
probably
possible
for
the
cosmos
itself
to
be
circumnavigated
in
the
starshine
but
its
crew
of
two
humans
could
find
no
planet
of
their
own
race
on
which
they
dared
to
land
they
approached
voorten
ii
and
found
a
great
planet
seemingly
empty
of
human
beings
there
were
roads
and
cities
but
the
roads
were
empty
and
the
cities
full
of
human
skeletons
kim
and
dona
saw
only
three
living
beings
of
human
form
and
they
were
skin
and
bones
and
shook
clenched
fists
and
gibbered
at
the
slim
space
craft
as
it
hovered
overhead
the
starshine
soared
away
it
hovered
over
makab
vi
and
there
were
towers
which
had
been
power
houses
rusting
into
ruin
and
human
beings
naked
and
chained
pulling
ploughs
while
other
human
beings
flourished
whips
behind
them
the
great
metropolis
where
the
matter
transmitter
should
have
been
was
ruins
unquestionably
the
matter
transmitter
here
had
been
destroyed
and
the
planet
was
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
civilization
they
came
fearfully
to
rest
above
the
planet
center
upon
moteh
vii
and
saw
decay
the
people
reveled
in
the
streets
but
listlessly
and
the
communicator
brought
only
barbarous
sensual
music
and
howled
songs
of
a
beastliness
that
was
impossible
to
describe
the
vessel
actually
touched
ground
upon
xanin
v
kim
and
dona
actually
talked
to
two
citizens
but
those
folk
were
blank
faced
and
dull
yet
what
they
told
kim
and
dona
apathetically
in
response
to
questioning
was
so
disheartening
that
dona
impulsively
offered
to
take
them
away
but
the
two
citizens
were
frightened
at
the
idea
they
fled
when
dona
would
have
urged
them
out
in
clear
space
again
on
interplanetary
drive
kim
looked
at
dona
with
brooding
eyes
it
looks
as
if
we
can
t
find
a
home
dona
he
said
quietly
the
human
race
is
finished
we
completed
a
job
we
humans
we
conquered
a
galaxy
and
we
occupied
it
and
the
job
was
done
then
we
went
downhill
you
and
i
we
came
from
the
newest
planet
of
all
and
we
didn
t
fit
we
re
criminals
there
but
the
older
planets
like
these
are
indescribably
horrible
he
stopped
and
asked
wryly
what
shall
we
do
dona
i
d
have
liked
a
wedding
ceremony
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
dona
smiled
at
him
there
s
one
place
yet
the
prime
board
called
us
criminals
let
s
look
up
the
criminals
on
ades
maybe
and
it
s
just
possible
people
who
have
mustered
energy
and
independence
enough
to
commit
political
crimes
would
be
bearable
if
we
don
t
find
anything
there
why
we
ll
go
to
another
galaxy
choose
a
planet
and
settle
down
and
i
promise
i
won
t
be
sorry
kim
kim
made
his
computations
and
swung
the
starshine
carefully
he
was
able
to
center
the
course
of
the
space
ship
with
absolute
precision
upon
the
sun
around
which
ades
circled
slowly
in
lonely
majesty
he
pressed
the
matter
transmission
stud
and
the
alarm
bells
rang
stridently
and
there
was
the
sun
and
the
planet
ades
barely
half
a
million
miles
from
their
starting
point
it
was
not
a
large
planet
and
there
was
much
ice
and
snow
the
electron
telescope
showed
no
monster
cities
either
but
there
were
settlements
of
a
size
that
could
be
picked
out
kim
sent
the
starshine
toward
it
of
course
i
m
only
head
of
this
small
city
said
the
man
with
the
bearskin
hat
and
my
powers
are
limited
here
but
i
think
we
ll
find
plenty
to
join
us
i
ll
go
of
course
if
you
ll
take
me
kim
nodded
in
an
odd
grim
satisfaction
we
ll
set
up
matter
transmitters
he
suggested
then
there
ll
be
complete
and
continuous
communication
with
this
planet
from
the
start
right
said
the
man
with
the
bearskin
hat
he
added
candidly
we
ve
brains
on
ades
my
friend
we
ve
got
every
technical
device
the
rest
of
the
galaxy
has
except
the
disciplinary
circuit
and
we
won
t
allow
that
if
this
is
a
scheme
of
some
damned
despot
to
add
another
planet
to
his
empire
it
won
t
work
there
are
three
empires
already
started
you
know
all
taken
by
matter
transmitter
but
that
won
t
work
here
if
you
build
the
transmitters
yourselves
you
ll
know
there
s
nothing
tricky
about
the
circuits
kim
said
my
offer
is
to
take
a
transmitter
and
an
exploring
party
to
the
next
nearest
galaxy
and
pick
out
a
planet
there
to
start
on
ades
isn
t
ideal
no
agreed
the
man
with
the
bearskin
hat
it
s
too
cold
and
we
re
overcrowded
there
are
twenty
million
of
us
and
more
keep
coming
out
of
the
transmitter
every
day
the
galaxy
seems
to
be
combing
out
all
its
brains
and
sending
them
all
here
we
re
short
of
minerals
though
metals
especially
so
we
ll
pick
some
good
sound
planets
to
start
on
over
in
a
second
galaxy
hm
come
to
the
communicator
and
we
ll
talk
to
the
other
men
we
need
to
reach
they
went
out
of
the
small
building
which
was
the
center
of
government
of
the
quite
small
city
there
was
nothing
impressive
about
it
anywhere
it
was
not
even
systematically
planned
each
citizen
it
appeared
had
built
as
he
chose
each
seemed
to
dress
as
he
pleased
too
to
kim
and
to
dona
there
was
a
startling
novelty
in
the
faces
they
saw
about
them
on
alphin
iii
almost
everybody
had
looked
alike
at
any
rate
their
faces
had
worn
the
same
expression
of
bovine
contentment
on
other
planets
contentment
had
not
been
the
prevailing
sentiment
on
some
despair
had
seemed
to
be
universal
but
these
people
these
criminals
were
individuals
their
manner
was
not
the
elaborate
cringing
politeness
of
alphin
iii
it
was
free
and
natural
the
communicator
station
was
rough
and
ready
it
was
not
a
work
of
art
but
a
building
put
up
by
people
who
needed
a
building
and
built
one
for
that
purpose
only
the
vision
screens
lighted
up
one
by
one
and
faces
appeared
as
variegated
as
the
costumes
beneath
them
they
had
a
common
look
for
aliveness
which
was
heartening
to
kim
the
conference
lasted
for
a
long
time
there
was
enthusiasm
and
there
was
reserve
the
starshine
would
carry
a
matter
transmitter
to
the
next
galaxy
and
open
a
way
for
migration
of
the
criminals
of
ades
to
a
new
island
universe
for
conquest
kim
would
turn
over
the
construction
records
of
the
space
ship
so
that
others
could
be
built
he
would
give
the
details
of
the
matter
transmitter
alteration
no
space
ships
had
been
attempted
by
the
inhabitants
of
ades
because
fighting
beams
would
soon
have
been
mounted
on
useful
planets
against
them
and
all
useful
planets
contained
only
enemies
what
do
you
want
asked
a
figure
in
one
vision
plate
we
don
t
do
things
for
nothing
here
and
we
don
t
take
things
without
paying
for
them
either
dona
and
i
want
only
a
place
to
live
and
a
people
to
live
among
who
are
free
kim
answered
sharply
you
ve
got
that
the
man
in
the
bearskin
hat
said
all
right
we
ll
all
call
public
meetings
and
confirm
these
arrangements
the
heads
of
other
cities
nodded
we
ll
pass
on
the
news
to
other
cities
at
once
another
man
said
he
was
one
of
those
who
had
nodded
everybody
will
wish
to
come
in
on
it
of
course
if
not
now
then
later
wait
kim
said
suddenly
how
about
the
planets
around
us
are
we
going
to
leave
them
enslaved
nobody
can
free
a
slave
a
whiskered
man
in
a
vision
plate
said
drily
we
could
only
release
prisoners
in
time
we
may
have
to
take
them
over
i
suppose
but
on
the
planet
i
come
from
there
aren
t
a
dozen
men
who
d
know
how
to
be
free
if
we
emancipated
them
they
don
t
want
to
be
free
they
re
satisfied
as
they
are
if
any
of
them
want
to
be
free
they
ll
be
sent
here
eventually
i
am
reluctant
to
desert
them
kim
answered
slowly
count
man
the
man
with
bearskin
hat
cried
there
are
three
hundred
million
inhabited
planets
all
of
them
but
ades
are
ruled
by
disciplinary
circuits
if
we
set
out
to
liberate
them
it
would
take
one
thousand
years
and
there
are
only
twenty
million
of
us
designate
just
one
of
us
to
stay
on
each
planet
to
teach
the
people
to
be
free
again
otherwise
we
wouldn
t
do
a
tenth
of
the
job
and
we
d
destroy
ourselves
by
scattering
but
hang
it
all
we
d
be
tyrants
no
we
go
on
and
start
on
a
new
galaxy
that
s
a
job
worth
doing
we
ll
keep
a
group
of
watchers
here
to
receive
the
new
ones
who
come
here
into
exile
and
forward
them
some
day
maybe
we
ll
come
back
and
take
over
the
old
galaxy
if
it
seems
worth
while
but
we
ve
a
job
to
do
how
many
galaxies
are
there
anyhow
for
us
and
our
children
and
our
children
s
children
to
take
over
it
s
a
job
that
will
never
be
finished
another
voice
said
that
s
good
there
were
trees
visible
from
the
window
of
the
house
that
had
been
offered
by
a
citizen
for
kim
s
and
dona
s
use
the
sun
went
down
beyond
those
trees
with
a
glowing
of
many
colors
in
the
foliage
kim
had
never
watched
a
sunset
before
except
upon
the
towers
and
pinnacles
of
a
city
he
had
never
noted
quite
this
sharp
tang
in
the
air
either
which
he
learned
was
the
smell
of
fresh
growing
things
i
think
i
m
going
to
like
living
like
this
he
said
to
dona
have
you
noticed
the
way
people
act
they
don
t
behave
as
if
i
were
important
at
all
in
one
way
they
seem
to
think
i
m
commonplace
but
i
ve
never
before
felt
so
definitely
that
i
matter
you
do
kim
darling
dona
said
wisely
she
stood
close
beside
him
watching
the
sunset
too
she
looked
up
at
him
you
matter
enormously
and
they
know
it
but
to
themselves
they
matter
too
and
when
they
listen
to
you
and
agree
with
you
it
s
because
they
mean
it
instead
of
just
citizen
like
politeness
it
is
good
i
think
it
must
be
a
part
of
what
we
ve
been
looking
for
it
s
a
part
of
freedom
i
suppose
and
you
kim
said
do
you
feel
important
too
she
laughed
at
him
and
pressed
close
my
dear
she
said
could
i
help
it
can
any
woman
help
feeling
important
on
her
wedding
day
do
you
realize
that
we
ve
been
married

whole
hours

asking
permission

kim
stared
up
at
the
unfamiliar
stars
of
the
second
galaxy
and
picked
out
a
tiny
winking
light
with
his
eyes
he
moved
to
a

and

he
added
it

a

i
ve
been
expecting
something
like
this
we
need
fuel
for
the
starshine
if
we
re
not
to
be
stuck
on
this

forever
my
guess
is
that
somebody
has
come
through
the
matter

from
ades
to
argue
about
it
he
moved
to
the

of
the

and
stood
beside
him
her
hand
twisting
into
his
the
night
was
very
dark
and
the
two
small
moons
of
terranova
cast
no
more
than
enough
light
to
outline
nearby

the

down
black
and
seemingly
ungainly
with
spinning
rotors
that

and
controlled
its

rather
than
sustaining
it

flexible

said
kim
rendell
into
the
darkness
two
men
came
across
the
matted
lawn
to
the
terrace
one
was
the
colony
organizer
for
terranova
and
the
other
was
the
definitely
rough
and
ready
mayor
of
steadheim
a
small
settlement
on
ades
back
in
the
first
galaxy
i
am
honored
said
kim
in
the
stock
phrase
of
greeting
the
two
figures
came
heavily
up
on
the
terrace
dona
went
indoors
and
came
back
with
refreshments
according
to
the
custom
of
ades
and
terranova
the
visitors
accepted
the
glasses
in
which
ice
tinkled
musically
you
seem
depressed
said
kim
politely
another
stock
phrase
it
was
a
way
of
getting
immediately
to
business
there

trouble
growled
the
mayor
of
steadheim
bad
trouble
it
couldn
t
be
worse
it
looks
like
ades
is
going
to
be
wiped
out
for
lack
of
space
ships
and
fuel
lack
of
space
ships
and
fuel
protested
kim
but
you
re
making
them
we
thought
we
were
growled
the
mayor
we
ve
stopped
we
re
stuck
we
re
finished
and
the
ships
aren
t
the
same
with
the
fuel
there
s
not
a
drop
for
you
and
things
look
bad
but
we
can
t
make
ships
and
we
couldn
t
make
fuel
for
them
if
we
could
that
s
why
we
ve
come
to
you
we
ve
got
to
have
those
ships
but
why
not
demanded
kim
what
s
preventing
it
you
ve
got
the
record
reels
from
the
starshine
they
tell
you
everything
from
the
first
steps
in
making
a
ship
to
the
last
least
item
of
its
outfitting
you
know
how
to
make
fuel
space
exploded
the
mayor
of
steadheim
of
course
we
know
how
we
know
all
about
it
there
are
fifty
useless
hulks
in
a
neat
row
outside
my
city
every
one
unfinished
we
re
short
of
metal
on
ades
and
we
had
to
melt
down
tools
to
make
them
but
we
did
as
far
as
we
could
go
now
we
re
stuck
and
we
re
apt
to
be
wiped
out
because
of
it
the
mayor
of
steadheim
wore
a
bearskin
cap
and
his
costume
was
appropriate
to
that
part
of
ades
in
which
his
municipality
lay
he
was
dressed
for
a
sub
arctic
climate
not
for
the
balmy
warmth
of
terranova
where
kim
rendell
had
made
his
homestead
he
sweated
as
he
gulped
at
his
drink
tell
me
the
trouble
said
kim
maybe
hafnium
barked
the
mayor
there
s
no
hafnium
on
ades
the
ships
are
done
all
but
the
fuel
catalyzers
the
fuel
is
ready
all
but
the
first
catalyzation
that
prepares
it
to
be
put
in
a
ship
s
tanks
we
have
to
have
hafnium
to
make
catalyzers
for
the

we
have
to
have
hafnium
to
make
the

we
haven

got
it
there
s
not
an
atom
of
it
on
the
planet
we
re
so
short
of
heavy
elements
anyhow
that
we
make
hammers
out
of
magnesium
alloy
and
put
stones
in
em
to
give
them
weight
so
they
ll
strike
a
real
blow
we
haven
t
got
an
atom
of
hafnium
and
we
can
t
make
ships
or
run
them
either
without
it
kim
blinked
at
the
colony
organizer
for
terranova
here
no
hafnium
here
either
said
the
colony
organizer
gloomily
we
analyzed
a
huge
sample
of
ocean
salts
if
there
were
any
on
the
planet
there
d
be
a
trace
in
the
ocean
naturally
so
what
do
we
do
kim
spoke
unhappily
i
wouldn
t
know
i
m
a
matter
transmitter
technician
i
can
do
things
with
power
and
of
course
i
understand
the
starshine
s
engines
but
there
s
no
record
of
the
early
primitive
types
that
went
before
them
types
that
might
work
on
other
fuel
maybe
in
some
library
on
one
of
the
older
planets
but
at
that
the
fuel
the
starshine
used
was
so
perfect
that
it
would
be
recorded
thousands
of
years
back
take
a
year
to
find
it
said
the
mayor
of
steadheim
bitterly
if
we
could
search
and
it
might
be
no
good
then
we
haven
t
got
a
year
probably
we
haven
t
a
month
we
re
beaten
mourned
the
colony
organizer
all
we
can
do
is
get
as
many
through
the
transmitter
from
ades
as
possible
and
go
on
half
rations
but
we
ll
starve
we
re
not
beaten
roared
the
mayor
of
steadheim
we
ll
get
hafnium
and
have
a
fighting
fleet
and
fuel
to
power
it
there
s
plenty
of
the
blasted
stuff
somewhere
in
the
galaxy
kim
rendell
if
i
find
out
where
it
is
will
you
go
get
it
the
starshine
said
kim
grimly
barely
made
it
to
port
here
there
s
less
than
six
hours
fuel
left
and
who
d
sell
us
hafnium
demanded
the
colony
organizer
bitterly
we
re
the
men
of
ades
the
rebels
the
outlaws
we
were
sent
to
ades
to
keep
us
from
contaminating
the
sheep
who
live
under
governments
with
disciplinary
circuits
and
think
they
re
men
we
d
be
killed
on
sight
for
breaking
our
exile
on
any
planet
in
the
first
galaxy
who
d
sell
us
hafnium
who
spoke
of
buying
roared
the
mayor
i
was
sent
to
ades
for
murder
i
m
not
above
killing
again
for
the
things
i

tall

you

i
won
t
kill
for
them
you
speak
of
piracy
said
the
colony
organizer
distastefully
piracy
murder
what
s
the
difference
when
my
sons
are
in
danger
what
s
this
danger
kim
said
sharply
it
s
bad
enough
to
be
grounded
as
we
seem
to
be
but
you
said
just
now
sinab
two
snorted
the
mayor
of
steadheim
that
s
the
danger
we
know
when
a
man
becomes
a
criminal
anywhere
he
s
sent
to
us
in
the
first
galaxy
a
man
with
brains
usually
becomes
a
criminal
a
free
man
always
does
so
we
ve
known
for
a
long
while
there
were
empires
in
the
making
you
heard
that
kim
rendell
yes
i
ve
heard
that
agreed
kim
so
he
had
but
only
vaguely
his
own
home
planet
alphin
three
was
ostensibly
a
technarchy
ruled
by
men
chosen
for
their
aptitude
for
public
affairs
by
psychological
tests
and
given
power
after
long
training
actually
it
was
a
tyranny
ruled
by
members
of
the
prime
council
other
planets
were
despotisms
or
oligarchies
and
many
were
kingdoms
these
days
every
possible
form
of
government
was
represented
in
the
three
hundred
million
inhabited
planets
of
the
first
galaxy
but
every
planet
was
independent
and
in
all
by
virtue
of
the
disciplinary
circuit
the
government
was
absolute
and
hence
tyrannical
empires
however
were
something
new
on
ades
kim
barely
heard
that
three
were
in
process
of
formation
one
s
the
empire
of
greater
sinab
snorted
the
mayor
and
we
ve
just
heard
how
it
grows
surprise
attacks
no
doubt
said
kim
through
matter
transmitters
we
d
not
worry
if
that
were
all
snapped
the
mayor
it
s
vastly
worse
you
know
the
old
fighting
beams
i
know
them
said
kim
grimly
the
deadly
beams
he
did
they
were
the
most
terrible
weapons
ever
created
by
men
they
had
ended
war
by
making
all
battles
mass
suicide
for
both
sides
they
were
beams
of
the
same
neuronic
frequencies
utilized
in
the
disciplinary
circuits
which
kept
men
enslaved
but
where
the
disciplinary
circuits
were
used
in
place
of
police
and
prisons
and
merely
tortured
the
individual
citizen
to
whom
they
were
tuned
wherever
he
might
be
upon
a
planet
the
fighting
beams
killed
indiscriminately
they
induced
monstrous
murderous
currents
in
any
living
tissue
containing
the
amino
chains
normally
a
part
of
human
flesh
they
were
death
rays
they
killed
men
and
women
and
children
alike
in
instants
of
shrieking
agony
but
no
planet
could
be
attacked
from
space
if
it
was
defended
by
such
beams
it
was
two
thousand
years
since
the
last
attempt
at
attack
from
space
had
been
made
that
fleet
had
been
detected
far
out
and
swept
with
fighting
beams
and
every
living
thing
in
the
attacking
ships
died
instantly
so
planets
were
independent
of
each
other
but
when
space
ships
ceased
to
be
used
the
fighting
beams
were
needless
and
ultimately
were
scrapped
or
put
into
museums
somebody
the
mayor
said
wrathfully
has
changed
those
beams
they
re
not
tuned
to
animal
tissue
in
general
any
more
they
re
tuned
to
male
tissue
to
blood
containing
male
hormones
perhaps
and
sinab
two
is
building
an
empire
with
em
we
found
out
only
two
weeks
ago
there

a

near

four
four
years

its

ceased
to
operate
the
galaxy
s
going
to
pot
anyhow
nothing
new
about
that
but
we
just
learned
the
real
reason
the
real
reason
was
that
four
years
ago
fighting
beams
killed
men
and
left
women
unharmed
every
man
on
thom
four
died
as
the
planet
rotated
the
beams
came
from
space
every
man
and
every
boy
and
every
male
baby
died
there
were
only
girls
and
women
left
he
added
curtly
there
were
half
a
billion
people
on
thom
four
kim
stiffened
dona
beside
him
drew
closer
every
man
killed
said
kim
what
the
mayor
of
steadheim
swore
angrily
half
the
population
on
ades
we
re
nine
tenths
men

there
d
not
be
much
left
on

if
those
beams
swept
us
but
i
m
talking
about
thom
four
the
men
died
all
of
them
so
many
that
the
women
couldn
t
bury
them
all
one
instant
the

was
going
about
its
business
as

when
they

to
go
to
the

ask
for

from
other

the

was
smashed
they
didn

they
couldn
t
believe
it
they
called
from

to

before
they
realized
theirs
was
a
manless
world
then
when
they
d
have
told
the
men
of
another

what
had
happened
they
couldn

for

there

the

the

grew
up
some
couldn
t
remember
ever
seeing
a
man
no
communication
with
other
worlds
then
one
day
there
was
a
new
matter
transmitter
in
the
place
of
the
smashed
one
men
came
out
of
it
the
women
crowded
about
them
the
men
were
very
friendly
they
were
from
sinab
two
their
employer
had
sent
them
to
colonize
there
were
a
thousand
women
to
every
man
ten
thousand
some
of
the
women
realized
what
had
been
done
they
d
have
killed
the
newcomers
but
some
women
fell
in
love
with
them
of
course
in
a
matter
of
days
every
man
had
women
ready
to
fight
all
other
women
who
would
harm
him
their
own
men
were
dead
four
years
what
else
could
they
do
more
and
more
men
colonists
came
presently
things
settled
down
the
men
were
happy
enough
they
d
no
need
to
work
with
all
the
women
about
they
established
polygamy
naturally
presently
it
was
understood
that
thom
four
was
part
of
the
empire
of
greater
sinab
so
it
was
what
else
in
a
generation
there
ll
be
a
new
population
all
its
citizens
descended
from
loyal

of

and
why
shouldn
t
they
be
loyal
a
million
colonists
inherited
the
possessions
and
the
women
of
a

it

developed
everything
was
built
every
man
was
rich
and
with
a
harem
a
darned
clever
way
to
build
an
empire

d
want
to
revolt
and
who
could

tranquilly

the

four

a

smashed
the

on
the

which
set
it
to

and
traveled
to

to

they
laughed
at

and
when
she
begged

a
distant

they
grinned
and
sent
her
to

doubtless
from

trying

it
was
clear
enough
she
d
told
the
truth
so
said
kim
slowly
you

ades
will
be
next
i

it
said
the
mayor
of

we
ve
checked
the

that

in
our

twenty

have
ceased
to

in
the
past
few
years
the
twenty

nearest

we
figured
khiv

be

then
we

be

it
khiv

every

we

all

khiv

cut
off
it
s
inhabited
only
by
women
going
mad
with
grief
in
a
few
years
when
they
grieve
no
longer
but
despair
instead
new
colonists
from

will
come
out
of
a

to
let
the

fall
in
love
with
them
and
to
breed
new
subjects
for
the
empire
of

so
we
ve
got
to
have
space
ships
man
we
ve
got
to
kim
was
silent
his
face
was
hard
and
grim
twenty
planets
those
so
and
so

have
taken

roared
the

they

not
less

the

the

for
reward
d
you

i

let
that
happen
to

across
the

kim

surely
safe
but
any
woman
can
feel
fear
for
her
man
on
any
excuse
it
s
a
hard
problem
said
kim
evenly
we
barely
made
terranova
with
the
starshine
and
there
s
just
about
enough
fuel
left
to
take

course
on

she
could
go
anywhere
but
i
doubt
that
we

fuel
enough
to
land

here
on

we
need

from

if

we

and
even
if

and
they

have
a

prepared
to
fight
anything
dona
murmured
in
his
ear
we
re
beaten
then
said
the
colony
organizer
bitterly
ades

be
wiped
out
we
ll
starve
and
the
sinabians
will
go
through
the
first
galaxy
killing
off
the
men
on
planet
after
planet
and
then
moving
in
to
take

murmured
again
in
kim
s
ear
the
mayor
of
steadheim
growled
profanely
furiously
dona
laughed
softly
the
two
visitors
stared
at
her
suspiciously
what
do
we
do
kim
rendell
i
suppose
said
kim
wryly
we
ll
have
to
fight
we
ve
no
fuel
and
no
weapons
but
that
ought
to
surprise
them
eh
they
ll
be
prepared
kim
explained
to
defend
themselves
against
any
conceivable
resistance
by
any
conceivable
weapon
and
a
warship
a
fairly
intelligent
planet
could
build
should
be
able
to
wipe
out
ten
thousand
starshines
so
when
we
attack
them
without
any
weapons
at
all
they
won
t
quite
know
what
to
do
the
two
visitors
simply
stared
at
him
you
ve
got
to
get
hafnium
you
ve
got
to
get
fuel
you
can
t
face
a
battleship
but
said
kim
battleships
have
fuel
on
board
and
they
ll
have
hafnium
too
it
ll
be
risky
but
convenient
contact
actually
there
was
less
than
a
quart
of
fuel
in
the
starshine
s
tanks
kim
knew
it
ruefully
well
it
would
run
the
little
ship
at
interplanetary
speed
for
perhaps
six
hours
on
normal
overdrive
two
hundred
light
speeds
it
would
send
her
just
about
one
seventh
of
a
light
year
and
star
systems
averaged
eight
light
years
apart
in
both
the
first
and
second
galaxies
of
course
on
transmitter
drive
the
practically
infinite
speed
the
starshine
alone
in
history
had
attained
the
ship
might
circumnavigate
the
cosmos
on
a
quart
of
fuel
but
merely
rising
from
terranova
would
consume
one
third
of
it
and
landing
on
any
other
planet
would
take
another
third
actually
the
little
ship
was
in
the
position
of
being
able
to
go
almost
anywhere
but
of
having
no
hope
at
all
of
being
able
to
come
back
it
rose
from
terranova
though
just
three
days
after
the
emergency
was
made
clear
there
were
a
few
small
gadgets
on
board
hastily
made
in
the
intervening
seventy
two
hours
but
nothing
deadly
nothing
that
could
really
be
termed
a
weapon
the
starshine
climbed
beyond
the
atmosphere
of
the
second
galaxy
planet
it
went
on
overdrive
at
two
hundred
light
speeds
to
a
safe
distance
from
terranova
s
planetary
system
then
it
stopped
in
normal
space
not
stressed
to
allow
for
extra
speed
kim
jockeyed
it
with
infinite
care
until
it
was
aimed
straight
at
the
tiny
wisp
of
nebulous
light
which
was
the
first
galaxy
unthinkable
thousands
of
light
years
away
at
long
last
he
was
satisfied
he
pressed
the
transmitter
field
button
and
all
space
seemed
to
reel
about
the
ship
at
the
moment
the
transmitter
field
went
on
the
starshine
had
a
velocity
of
twenty
miles
per
second
and
a
mass
of
perhaps
two
hundred
tons
the
kinetic
energy
it
possessed
was
fixed
by
those
two
facts
but
when
the
transmitter
field
enveloped
it
its
mass
dropped
divided
by
a
factor
approaching
infinity
and
its
speed
necessarily
increased
in
exact
proportion
because
its
kinetic
energy
was
undiminished
it
was
enclosed
in
a
stressed
space
in
which
an
infinite
speed
was
possible
it
approached
that
infinite
speed
on
its
original
course
instantly
it
seemed
alarm
gongs
rang
and
the
cosmos
reeled
again
suddenly
there
was
a
glaring
light
pouring
in
the
forward
vision
ports
there
were
uncountable
millions
of
stars
all
about
and
almost
straight
ahead
a
monstrous
palpitating
cepheid
sun
swam
angrily
in
emptiness
the
starshine
had
leaped
the
gulf
between
galaxies
in
a
time
to
be
measured
in
heart
beats
and
the
transmitter
field
was
thrown
off
when
the
total
quantity
of
radiation
impinging
upon
a
sensitive
plate
before

had
reached
a
certain
total

watched
absorbedly
as
kim
made
his
observations
and
approximately
fixed
his
position
the
mayor
of
steadheim
looked
on
suspiciously
what
s
this
locating
ourselves
kim
explained
from
the
second

the
best
we
could
hope
for
was
to
hit

in

pretty
well
at

sixty

the

jockeyed
the

to

he
adjusted
the

switch
to
a
new
value
to

off
the

more
quickly
than
before
he
pressed
the
field
button
again
space
reeled
once
more
and
the
gongs
rang
and
they
were
deep
within
the

a
lurid
purple
sun
blazed
balefully

around

to
drop
into

at

necessary
for
taking
off
and
landing
but
terribly
wasteful
of
fuel
overdrive
had
been
the
triumph
of
space
navigation
for
thousands
of
years
it
was
like
the
second
gear
of
the
ancient
land
cars
and
the
transmitter
drive
of
kim
s
devising
was
high
speed
almost
infinite
speed
but
it
could
not
be
used
within
a
solar
system
it
was
too
fast
kim
drove
to
the
farther
orbit
of
khiv
five
and
then
went
into
a
long
slow
free
fall
toward
the
banded
planet
below
in
the
old
days
it
would
have
been
changed
to
a
landing
parabola
at
an
appropriate
moment
now
said
kim
grimly
my
guess
is
that
we
haven
t
enough
fuel
to
make
anything
but
a
crash
landing
which
would
mean
that
we
should
all
get
killed
so
we
will
hope
very
earnestly
that
a
warship
is
still
hanging
about
khiv
five
and
that
it
comes
and
tries
to
wipe
us
out
dona

a
tiny

so
slightly
from

mmmmm
said
kim
right
at
the
limit
of
the

something

he
waited
and
waited
and
waited
the
small
hundred
foot
hull
of
the
space
ship
seemed
motionless
seen
from
without
the
stars
were
infinitely
far
away
the
great
ringed
sun

a
hundred
and
twenty
million
miles
distant
even
the
belted
planet
khiv
five
was
a
good
half
million
miles
below
such
motion
as
the
starshine
possessed
was
imperceptible
it
floated
with
a
vast
leisureliness
in
what
would
be
a
parabolic
semi
orbit
but
it
would
take
days
to
make
sure
and
meanwhile
meanwhile
the
starshine
seemed
to
spawn
a
small
object
appeared
astern
suddenly
it
writhed
convulsively
light
glinted
upon
it
it
whirled
dizzily
then
more
dizzily
still
and
abruptly
it
was
a
shape
it
was
in
fact
the
shape
of
a
space
ship
practically
the
size
of
the
starshine
itself
but
somehow
it
was
not
quite
substantial
for
minutes
it
shimmered
and
quivered
you
ll
find
it
instructive
said
kim
drily
to
the
mayor
of
steadheim
to
look
out
of
a
stern
port
the
mayor
lumbered
toward
a
stern
port
a
moment
later
they
heard
him
shout
minutes
later
he
lumbered
back
what
s
that
he
said
angrily
i
thought
it
was
another
ship
when
i
first
saw
it
i
thought
it
was
ramming
us
it
s
a
gadget
said
kim
abstractedly
his
eyes
were
on
the
indicator
of
one
of
the
detectors
the
needle
was
definitely
away
from
its
point
of
rest
there
s
something
moving
toward
us
my
guess
is
that
it
s
a
warship
with
fighting
beams
and
hafnium
and
fuel
encounter
in
the
void
the
mayor
of
steadheim
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
them
dona
was
pale
she
looked
full
of
dread
kim
s
lips
were
twisted
wryly
but
his
eyes
were
intent
on
the
dial
the
mayor
opened
his
mouth
and
closed
it
then
spoke
wrathfully
i
don
t
understand
all
this
where
d
that
other
ship
come
from
it
isn
t
a
ship
said
kim
watching
the
dial
that
told
of
the
approach
of
something
that
could
only
be
an
enemy
and
it
had
been
a
matter
of
faith
that
only
the
starshine
roamed
the
space
ways
i
got
it
made
back
on
terranova
we
took
a
big
reel
of
metal
spring
wire
and
wound
it
round
and
round
a
shape
like
that
of
the
starshine
when
it
was
in
place
we
annealed
and
tempered
it
so
it
would
always
resume
that
shape
and
then
we
wound
it
back
on
its
reel
i
just
dumped
it
out
in
space
from
a
special
lock
astern
it
began
to
unroll
and
of
course
to
go
back
to
the
form
it
had
been
tempered
in
here
with
no
gravity
to
distort
it
it
went
perfectly
back
into
shape
close
to
of
course
you
can
see
it
s
only
a
shell
and
a
thin
one
but
a
few
miles
away
it
would
fool
you
the
needle
on
the
detector
dial
crept
over
and
over
kim
wet
his
lips
dona
s
face
was
white
then
kim
winced
and
the
mayor
of
steadheim
roared
furiously
and
the
universe
without
the
viewports
swayed
and
dissolved
into
something
else
alarm
gongs
rang
and
the
starshine
was
in
a
brand
new
place
with
a
blue
white
giant
sun
and
a
dwarf
companion
visible
nearby
the
ringed
sun
khiv

vanished
k
kim
said
dona
choking
i
m
quite
all
right
he
told
her
but
he
wiped
sweat
off
his
face
those
beams
aren
t
pleasant
no
matter
how
short
the
feeling
is
he
turned
back
to
the
controls
the
faint
whine
of
the
gyros
began
the
starshine
began
to
turn
about
kim
applied
power
but
it
took
a
long
time
for
the
ship
s
nose
to
be
turned
exactly
and
precisely
back
in
the
direction
from
which
it
had
come
it
s
getting
ticklish
he
said
abruptly
there
s
less
than
a
cupful
of
fuel
left
space
said
the
mayor
of
steadheim
he
looked
sick
and
weak
and
frightened
what
happened
we
were
in
a
sort
of
orbit
about
khiv
five
said
kim
succinctly
we
had
a
decoy
ship
out
behind
us
a
warship
spotted
our
arrival
it
sneaked
up
on
us
and
let
go
a
blast
of
its
beams
the
same
beams
that
killed
all
the
men
on
khiv
five
they
didn
t
bother
dona
she
s
a
girl
but
they
would
have
killed
us
had
not
a
relay
flung
the
starshine
away
from
there
the
beams
got
left
behind
so
did
the
dummy
ship
i
think
they
ll
clamp
on
to
it
to
look
it
over
and
if
our
engines
keep
turning
over
long
enough
we
ll
be
all
right
now
let
s
see
his
jaw
was
set
as
the
transmitter
drive
came
on
and
the
familiar
crazy
gyration
of
all
the
stars
again
took
place
and
the
gongs
rang
once
more
but
his
astrogation
was
perfect
there
was
the
ringed
sun
khiv
again
with
its
banded
fifth
planet
and
its
polar
ice
cap
and
its
equatorial
belt
of
desert
with
the
wide
bands
of
irrigated
land
crossing
it
kim
drove
for
the
planet
he
looked
at
the
fuel
gauge
our
tanks
he
said
evenly
read
empty
what
fuel

left
is
in
the
catalyzer
a
needle
stirred
on
the
bank
of
indicators
dona
caught
her
breath
kim
sweated
the
indication
on
the
dial
grew
stronger
the
electron
telescope
field
sparkled
suddenly
where
light
glinted
on
glistening
metal
kim
corrected
course
subtly
there
was
the
tiny
form
which
looked
so
amazingly
like
a
duplicate
of
the
starshine
it
was
actually
a
thin
layer
of
innumerable
turns
of
spring
wire
on
any
planet
it
would
have
collapsed
of
its
own
weight
here
in
space
it
looked
remarkably
convincing
but
the
three
in
the
starshine
did
not
look
at
it
they
looked
at
the
shape
that
had
come
alongside
it
and
made
fast
with
magnetic
grapples
that
distorted
the
thin
decoy
wildly
the
shape
that
gave
no
sign
of
any
activity
or
any
motion
or
any
life
that
shape
was
a
monster
space
ship
a
thousand
feet
long
it
looked
as
if
it
bulged
with
apparatus
of
death
it
was
gigantic
it
was
deadly
our
trick
worked
said
kim
uneasily
we
should
begin
to
feel
uncomfortable
you
and
i
in
minutes
if
only
our
engines
keep
running
he
spoke
to
the
mayor
of
steadheim
almost
as
he
spoke
a
tiny
tingling
began
all
over
his
body
as
the
ship
went
on
that
tingling
grew
noticeably
stronger
what
we
ve
no
weapons
said
kim
nor
time
to
devise
them
but
when
we
were
slaves
on
the
planets
we
came
from
we
were
held
enslaved
by
a
circuit
that
could
torture
us
or
paralyze
us
at
the
will
of
our
rulers
the
disciplinary
circuit
remember
i
put
a
disciplinary
circuit
generator
in
that
little
decoy
ship
i
took
a
suggestion
from
what
our
friends
yonder
did
to
the
fighting
beams
i
tuned
the
disciplinary
circuit
to
affect
any
man
but
no
woman
within
its
range
the
generator
went
on
when
she
grappled
the
decoy
every
man
in
it
should
be
helpless
if
it
stands
like
that
we
d
be
paralyzed
too
if
we
went
near
but
not
dona
the
tingling
was
quite
strong
it
was
painful
presently
it
would
be
excruciating
it
would
be
completely
impossible
for
any
man
within
fifty
miles
of
the
decoy
space
ship
to
move
a
muscle
however
said
kim
i
ve
arranged
that
i
had
disciplinary
circuit
projectors
fitted
on
the
starshine
we
turn
them
on
that
ship
automatically
the
generator
on
the
decoy
will
cut
off
our
friends
will
still
be
helpless
and
we
can
go
up
and
grapple
if
our
engines
keep
going
he
threw
a
switch
a
relay
snapped
over
somewhere
and
a
faint
humming
noise
began
the
tingling
of
kim
s
body
ceased
the
decoy
and
the
enemy

grew
large
before
them
the

motionless
its

from

out
in

on
kim

ever

gently
into

they
failed
finally
the
immobile
monster
alongside
would
become
a
ravening
engine
of
destruction
the
two
men
in
the
starshine
would
die
in
an
instant
of
unspeakable
torment
dona
now
fumbling
desperately
through
unfamiliar
passage
ways
amid
contorted
glaring
figures
would
be
at
the
tender
mercy
of
the
crew
and
when
the
three
of
them
were
dead
the
drive
of
the
starshine
would
be
at
the
disposal
of
the
empire
of
greater
sinab
if
they
only
chose
to
look
at
it
the
beastly
scheme
of
conquest
would
spread
and
spread
and
spread
throughout
the
galaxy
and
enslave
all
women
and
murder
all
human
men
not
parties
to
the
criminality
the
lights
flickered
again
they
almost
died
and
on
the
starshine
kim
clenched
his
hands
in
absolute
despair
on
the
enemy
warship
the
immobile
crew
made
agonized
raging
movements
but
the
engine
caught
fugitively
once
more
and
dona
worked
desperately
and
then
fled
toward
the
airlock
with
her
booty
while
the
disciplinary
circuit
field
which
froze
the
sinabian
crew
wavered
and
tightened
and
wavered
once
more
and
died
dona
dragged
open
the
enemy
s
inner
airlock
door
as
a
howl
rose
behind
her
she
flung
open
the
outer
as
murderous
projectors
warmed
she
clattered
along
the
outer
hull
of
the
sinabian
ship
on
her
magnetic
shoes
and
saw
the
starshine
drifting
helplessly
away
even
the
grapples
powerless
to
hold
the
two
bodies
together
at
that
sight
dona
gasped
she
leaped
desperately
with
star
filled
nothingness
above
and
below
and
on
every
hand
she
caught
the
starshine
s
airlock
door
and
kim
cut
out
the
disciplinary
circuit
beams
and
the
flow
of
current
to
the
grapples
and
with
a
complete
absence
of
hope
pressed
the
transmitter
drive
button
he
had
no
shred
of
belief
that
it
would
work
but
it
did
the
equalizer
batteries
from
the
engines
gave
out
one
last
surge
of
feeble
power
and
were
dead
but
that
was
enough
since
nothing
else
drew
current
at
all
the
stars
reeled
this
was
a
test
almost
anything
could
happen
kim
held
his
breath
anxiously
watching
and
waiting
for
the
worst
his
senses
attuned
to
the
delicate
mechanisms
about
him
and
then
slowly
the
reaction
was
fully
determined
and
he
smiled
the
needed
fuel
the
starshine
had
a
mass
of
about
two
hundred
tons
and
an
intrinsic
velocity
of
so
many
miles
per
second
when
the
field
went
on
her
mass
dropped
almost
to
zero
but
her
kinetic
energy
remained
the
same
her
velocity
went
up
almost
to
infinity
and
the
universe
went
mad
the
vision
ports
showed
stark
lunacy
there
were
stars
but
they
were
the
stars
of
a
madman
s
dream
they
formed
and
dissolved
into
nothingness
in
instants
too
brief
for
estimate
for
fractions
of
micro
seconds
they
careered
upon
impossible
trajectories
across
the
vision
ports
field
of
view
now
a
monstrous
blue
white
sun
glared
in
terribly
seemingly
almost
touching
the
ship
an
instant
later
there
was
utter
blackness
all
about
then
colossal
flaring
globes
ringed
in
the
starshine
and
shriveling
heat
poured
in
then
there
was
a
blue
watery
seeming
cosmos
all
around
like
the
vision
of
an
underwater
world
and
dim
shapes
seemed
to
swim
in
it
and
then
stars
again
and
then
it
was
stark
gibbering
madness
but
kim
reached
the
instrument
board
with
the
end
of
the
last
morsel
of
power
he
had
ceased
to
have
weight
and
had
floated
clear
of
the
floor
and
everything
else
by
the
crazy
changing
light
he
sighted
himself
and
when
he
touched
a
sidewall
flung
himself
toward
the
now
dark
bank
of
instruments
he
caught
hold
fumbled
desperately
and
threw
the
switch
a
radiation
relay
should
have
thrown
and
then
the
madness
ended
there
was
stillness
there
was
nothing
anywhere
there
was
no
weight
within
the
ship
nor
light
nor
any
sound
save
the
heavy
breathing
of
kim
and
the
mayor
of
steadheim
the
vision
ports
showed
nothing
looking
carefully
with
eyes
losing
the
dazzle
of
now
vanished
suns
one
could
see
infinitely
faint
infinitely
distant
luminosities
the
starshine
was
somewhere
between
galaxies
somewhere
in
an
unspeakable
gulf
between
islands
of
space
in
the
dark
voids
which
are
the
abomination
of
desolation
there
were
small
clankings
aft
the
outer
airlock
door
went
shut
a
little
later
the
inner
door
opened
and
then
kim
swam
fiercely
through
weightlessness
and
clung
to
dona
still
in
her
space
suit
unable
to
speak
for
his
emotion
the
voice
of
the
mayor
of
steadheim
arose
in
the
darkness
which
was
the
interior
of
the
starshine
and
the
outer
cosmos
for
tens
of
thousands
of
light
years
all
about
dona
now
had
the
face
plate
of
her
helmet
open
she
kissed
kim
hungrily
brought
you
something
she
said
unsteadily
i
m
not
sure
what
but
something
they
ve
separate
engines
to
power
their
generators
on
that
ship
and
there
were
tanks
i
thought
were
fuel
tanks
space
roared
the
mayor
of
steadheim
forward
who
s
that
talking
am
i
dead
is
this
hades
you
re
not
dead
yet
kim
called
to
him
i
ll
tell
you
in
a
minute
if
you
will
be
there
were
no
emergency
lights
in
the
ship
but
dona
s
suit
was
necessarily
so
equipped
she
turned
on
lights
and
kim
looked
at
the
two
objects
she
had
brought
my
dear
he
told
her
you
did
it
a
little
fuel
tank
with
gallons
in
it
and
a
complete
catalyzer
by
the
size
of
it
one
of
their
beams
uses
an
engine
big
enough
for
fifty
ships
like
this
clutching
at
every
projection
he
made
his
way
to
the
engine
room
dona
followed
i
m
glad
kim
she
said
unsteadily
that
i
was
able
to
do
something
important
you
always
do
everything
the
heck
i
do
he
said
but
anyhow
he
worked
on
the
tank
she
d
sheared
it
off
with
a
tiny
atomic
torch
and
the
severed
fuel
line
had
closed
of
itself
of
course
he
spliced
it
into
the
starshine
s
fuel
line
and
waited
eagerly
for
the
heavy
viscid
fluid
to
reach
the
catalyzer
and
then
the
engines
we
ll
be
all
right
now
asked
dona
hopefully
we
were
on
transmitter
drive
for
five
minutes
at
a
guess
you
know
what
that
means
she
caught
her
breath
kim
we
re
lost
to
say
that
we
re
lost
is
a
masterpiece
of
understatement
he
said
wryly
at
transmitter
speed
we
could
cross
the
first
galaxy
in
a
ten
thousandth
of
a
second
which
means
roughly
a
hundred
thousand
light
years
in
a
ten
thousandth
of
a
second
and
we
traveled
for
three
hundred
seconds
or
thereabouts
what
are
our
chances
of
finding
our
way
back
oh
kim
she
cried
softly
it
s
unthinkable
he
watched
the
meters
suddenly
the
engines
caught
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
they
ran
irregularly
then
all
was
normal
there
was
light
there
was
weight
an
indignant
roar
came
from
forward
if
this
is
hades
they
went
to
the
control
room
the
mayor
of
steadheim
sat
on
the
floor
staring
incredulously
about
him
as
they
entered
he
grinned
sheepishly
i
was
floating
in
the
air
and
couldn
t
see
a
thing
and
then
the
lights
came
on
and
the
floor
smacked
me
what
happened
and
where
are
we
kim
went
to
the
instrument
board
and
plugged
in
the
heaters
already
the
vision
ports
had
begun
to
frost
and
the
air
purifier
and
the
other
normal
devices
of
a
space
ship
what
happened
is
simple
enough
said
kim
the
last
atom
of
power
on
board
the
ship
here
threw
us
into
transmitter
field
drive
and
when
that
field
is
established
it
doesn
t
take
power
to
maintain
it
so
we
started
to
move
there
s
a
relay
that
should
have
stopped
us
but
there
wasn
t
enough
power
left
to
work
it
so
we
traveled
for
probably
five
minutes
on
transmitter
drive
we
went
a
long
way
eh
said
the
mayor
comfortably
we
did
said
kim
grimly
to
ades
from
its
sun
is
ninety
million
miles
eight
light
minutes
minutes
remember
the
first

a

going
ninety
million
miles
every
eight
minutes
to
cross

the
starshine

a

years
in
the
ten
thousandth
part

a

the
most
powerful
telescope
in
the
galaxy
cannot
gather
light
from
so
far
away
but
we
went
at
least
three
hundred
times
farther
three
hundred
billion
light
years
plus
or
minus
thirty
billions
more
we
went
beyond
the
farthest
that
men
have
ever
seen
and
kept
on
beyond
the
farthest
that
men
have
ever
thought
of
the
light
from
the
island
universes
we
can
see
through
the

never
yet
reached

began
it
hasn
t
had
time
we
re
not
only
beyond
the
limits
that
men
have
guessed
at
we
re
beyond
their
wildest
imagining
the
mayor
of
steadheim
blinked
at
him
then
he
got
up
and
peered
out
the
vision
ports
dim
remote
luminosities
were
visible
each
one
a
galaxy
of
a
thousand
million
suns
hah
grunted
the
mayor
not
much
to
look
at
at
that
now
what
kim
spread
out
his
hands
and
looked
at
dona
turning
about
and
trying
to
go
back
he
said
would
be
like
starting
from
an
individual
grain
of
sand
on
a
desert
and
flying
a
thousand
miles
and
then
trying
to
fly
back
to
that
grain
of
sand
again
that
s
how
the
first
galaxy
stacks
up
dona
took
a
deep
breath
you
ll
find
a
way
kim
and
anyhow
she
smiled
at
him
shakily
whether
or
not
they
ever
saw
another
human
being
she
was
prepared
to
take
what
came
with
him
the
possibility
of
being
lost
amid
the
uncountable
island
universes
of
the
cosmos
had
been
known
to
them
both
from
the
beginning
of
the
use
of
the
starshine
we
ll
take
some
pictures
kim
told
her
and
then
sit
down
on
a
planet
and
figure
things
out
he
set
to
work
making
a
map
of
all
the
island
universes
in
view
of
the
starshine
s
current
position
with
due
regard
to
the
starshine
s
course
on
the
relatively
short
jumps
within
a
galaxy
and
especially
those
of
a
few
light
years
only
he
could
simply
turn
the
ship
about
and
come
very
close
to
his
original
position
the
line
of
it
anyhow
but
he
did
not
know
within
many
many
billions
of
light
years
how
far
he
had
come
and
he
did
know
that
an
error
of
a
hundredth
of
a
second
of
arc
would
amount
to
millions
of
light
years
at
the
distance
of
the
first
galaxy
the
positions
of
galaxies
about
the
first
were
plotted
only
within
a
radius
of
something
like
two
million
light
years
there
had
never
been
a
point
in
even
that
at
fifteen
hundred
thousand
times
that
distance
he
was
not
likely
to
strike
the
tiny
mapped
area
by
accident
he
set
to
work
presently
he
was
examining
the
photographs
by
enlarger
for
a
sign
of
structure
in
one
of
the
galaxies
in
view
one
showed
evidences
of
super
giant
stars
which
proved
it
the
nearest
he
aimed
the
starshine
for
it
he
threw
the
ship
into
transmitter
drive
the
galaxy
was
startlingly
familiar
when
they
reached
it
the
stellar
types
were
normal
ones
and
there
were
star
clusters
and
doubtless
star
drifts
too
and
kim
was
wholly
accustomed
to
astro
navigation
now
he
simply
chose
a
sol
type
sun
set
the
radiation
switch
to
stop
the
little
space
ship
close
by
aimed
for
it
and
pressed
a
button
instantly
they
were
there
they
visited
six
solar
systems
they
found
a
habitable
planet
in
the
last
a
bit
on
the
small
side
but
with
good
gravity
adequate
atmosphere
and
polar
ice
caps
to
assure
its
climate
they
landed
and
its
atmosphere
was
good
the
mayor
of
steadheim
stepped
out
and
blinked
about
him
hah
he
said
gruffly
if
we
ve
come
as
far
as
you
say
it
was
hardly
worth
the
trip
kim
grinned
it
looks
normal
enough
he
acknowledged
but
chemistry

said
the
mayor
of
steadheim
a
planet
like
this
for
each
of
my
four
sons
to
settle
on
now
when
we
ve
settled
with
those
rats
from
sinab
the
planet
was
a
desirable
one
the
starshine
had
come
to
rest
where
a
mountain
range
rose
out
of
lush
strange
forest
covered
hills
which
reached
away
and
away
to
a
greenish
sea
there
was
nothing
in
view
which
was
altogether
familiar
and
nothing
which
was
altogether
strange
the
mayor
of
steadheim
stamped
away
to
a
rocky
out
crop
where
he
would
have
an
even
better
view
poor
man
said
dona
softly
when
he
finds
out
that
we
can
never
go
back
and
there
ll
be
only
the
three
of
us
here
while
horrible
things
happen
back
back
home
but
kim
s
expression
had
suddenly
become
strained
i
think
he
said
softly
i
see
a
way
to
get
back
i
was
thinking
that
a
place
as
far
away
as
this
would
be
ideal
for
the
empire
of
sinab
to
be
moved
to
true
they
ve
murdered
all
the
men
on
nineteen
or
twenty
planets
but
we
couldn
t
repair
anything
by
murdering
all
of
them
in
return
if
we
moved
them
out
here
though
there
d
be
no
other
people
for
them
to
prey
on
they
d
regret
their
lost
opportunities
for
scoundrelism
but
their
real
penalty
would
be
that
they
d
have
to
learn
to
be
decent
in
order
to
survive
it
s
a
very
neat
answer
to
the
biggest
problem
of
the
war
with
sinab
a
post
war
settlement
but
we
haven
t
any
chance
of
getting
back
have
we
if
we
wanted
to
send
them
here
how
d
we
do
it
asked
kim
by
matter
transmitter
of
course
a
receiver
set
up
here
as
there
used
to
be
one
on
ades
to
which
a
sender
would
be
tuned
when
a
transmitter
s
tuned
to
a
receiver
you
can
t
miss
but
our
transmitter
drive
is
just
that
a
transmitter
which
sends
the
ship
and
itself
with
a
part
which
is
tuned
to
receive
itself
too
i
ll
set
up
the
receiving
element
here
for
later
use
and
i
ll
tune
the

element
to
ades
we
ll
arrive
at
the
station
there
and
everyone
will
be
surprised
he
paused
and
spoke
reflectively
a
curious
war
this
we
ve
no
weapons
and
we
arrive
at
a
post
war
settlement
before
we
start
fighting
we
ve
decided
how
to
keep
from
killing
our
enemies
before
we
re
sure
how
we
ll
defeat
them
and
i
suspect
that
the
men
had
better
stay
at
home
and
let
the
women
go
out
to
battle
i
m
not
sure
i
like
it
he
set
to
work
in
twelve
hours
one
half
of
the
transmitter
drive
of
the

had
been
removed
and
set
up
on
the
unnamed

of
a
galaxy
not
even
imagined
by
human
beings
before
in
fifteen
hours
the
starshine
rather
limpingly
went
aloft
an
hour
later
kim
carefully
tuned
the

off
from

apparently
by
the
failure
of
their

actually
those
twenty

were
the
cradles
of
a
new
and
horrible
type
of
civilization
on
the
other
inhabited
worlds
every
conceivable
type
of
tyranny
had
come
into
being
sustained
by
the
disciplinary
circuit
which
put
every
citizen
at
the
mercy
of
his
government
throughout
every
moment
of
his
life
on
most
worlds
kings
and
oligarchs
reveled
in
the
primitive
satisfaction
of
arbitrary
power
there
is
an
instinct
still
surviving
among
men
which
allows
power
as
such
to
become
an
end
in
itself
and
when
it
is
attained
to
be
exercised
without
purpose
save
for
its
own
display
some
men
use
power
to
force
abject
submission
or
fawning
servility
or
stark
terror
in
the
empire
of
greater
sinab
there
was
merely
the
novelty
that
the
rulers
craved
adulation
and
got
it
the
rulers
of
sinab
were
without
doubt
served
by
the
most
enthusiastic
most
loyal
most
ardently
cooperative
subjects
ever
known
among
men
every
member
of
the
male
population
of
sinab
where
women
were
considered
practically
a
lower
species
of
animal
could
look
forward
confidently
to
a
life
of
utter
ease
on
one
planet
or
another
served
and
caressed
by
solicitous
females
with
no
particular
obligation
save
to
admire
and
revere
his
rulers
and
to
breed
more
subjects
for
them
it
made
for
loyalty
but
not
for
undue
energy
there
was
no
great
worry
about
the
progress
of
the
splendid
plan
for
a
greater
sinab
all
went
well
the
planet
khiv
five
had
been
beamed
from
space
some
nine
days
since
every
man
upon
the
planet
had
died
in
one
instant
of
unholy
anguish
during
which
tetanic
convulsions
of
the
muscles
of
his
heart
burst
it
while
the
ligaments
and
anchorages
of
other
muscles
were
torn
free
of
his
skeleton
by
the
terrific
contraction
of
muscle
fibres
every
woman
on
khiv
five
was
still
in
a
state
of
frantic
grief
which
would
become
despair
only
with
the
passage
of
time
it
was
strange
that
two
guard
ships
circling
khiv
five
no
longer
reported
to
headquarters
but
it
was
unthinkable
that
any
harm
could
have
come
to
them
records
showed
that
no
other
planet
had
practiced
space
travel
for
centuries
or
millennia
only
the
empire
of
sinab
had
revived
the
ancient
art
for
purposes
of
conquest
there
was
no
reason
to
be
solicitous
so
the
empire
of
sinab
waited
somnolently
for
time
to
pass
when
colonists
would
be
called
upon
to
take
over
the
manless
khiv
five
and
all
its
cities
and
its
women
there
was
another
small
planet
called
ades
next
in
order
for
absorption
into
the
empire
a
squadron
had
been
dispatched
to
beam
it
to
manlessness
though
volunteers
for
its
chilly
clime
would
not
be
numerous
the
failure
of
two
guard
ships
to
report
of
course
could
have
no
meaning
to
that
other
squadron
of
course
not
there
were
no
space
ships
save
the
fleet
of
greater
sinab
there
were
no
weapons
mounted
for
use
against
space
craft
anywhere
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
the
expansion
of
greater
sinab
to
include
every
one
of
the
galaxy
s
three
hundred
million
inhabited
planets
so
nobody
worried
on
sinab
on
ades
it
was
different
that
small
planet
hummed
with
activity
it
was
not
the
ordered
regimented
from
above
sort
of
activity
any
other
planet
in
the
galaxy
would
have
shown
it
was
individual
activity
often
erratic
and
doubtless
inefficient
but
it
made
for
progress
first
of
course
a
steady
stream
of
human
beings
filed
into
the

with
terranova
in
the
second

gangling
boys
mostly
and
mothers
with
small
boy

made
the
journey
taking
them
to
terranova
where
the
beams
of
sinabian
murder
craft
could
not
cause
their
death
the
adults
of

were
not
anxious

there
were
only
one

savagely
refused
to
abandon

those

labored
furiously
to
complete
the
space
ships
that
waited
for
their
finishing
touches
on
the
outskirts
of
every
community
on
the
planet
the
small
drum
of
fuel
taken
by
dona
from
the
warship
off
khiv
five
was
depleted
by
kim
s
use
of
it
but
the
rest
was
enormously
useful
the
catalyzer
from
the
same
warship
was
taken
apart
and
its
precious
hafnium
parts
recovered
and
then
the
values
of
individualism
appeared
a
physicist
who
had
been
exiled
from
muharram
two
for
the
crime
of
criticizing
a
magistrate
presented
himself
as
an
expert
on
autocatalysis
with
a
sample
of
the
catalyzed
fuel
to
start
the
process
he
shortly
had
a
small
plant
turning
out
space
fuel
without
hafnium
at
all
the
catalyzed
fuel
itself
acted
as
a
catalyst
to
cause
other
fuel
to
take
the
desired
molecular
form
a
power
plant
engineer
from
hlond
three
seized
upon
the
principle
and
redesigned
the
catalyzers
to
be
made
for
the
ships
for
safety
s
sake
a
particle
of
hafnium
was
included
but
the
new
type
catalyzers
required
only
a
microscopic
speck
of
the
precious
material

from

of

extended
to
supply
the
engine

of
a
thousand

craft
of
the

design
in
a
myriad
other
ways
individuals
worked
at
their
chosen
problems
hundreds
undoubtedly
toiled
to
contrive
a
shield
for
the
fighting
beams
tuned
to
kill
men
only
which
were
the
means
by
which
ades
was
to
be
devastated
the
scientists
of
half
a
galaxy
had
tried
that
five
thousand
years
before
without
success
but
one
man
did
come
up
with
a
plausible
device
he
proposed
a
shielding
paint
containing
crystals
of
the
hormone
to
which
the
fighting
beams
were
tuned
the
crystalline
material
should
absorb
the
deadly
frequencies
so
they
could
not
pass
on
to
murder
men
it
would
have
been
simple
enough
to
synthesize
any
desired
organic
substance
but
kim
pointed
out
grimly
that
the
shield
would
be
made
useless
by
changing
the
tuning
of
the
beams
other
men
devised
horrific
and
generally
impractical
weapons
but
again
one
man
came
up
with
a
robot
ship
idea
a
ship
which
could
be
fought
without
humans
on
board
and
controlled
even
at
interstellar
distances
radio
signals
at
the
speed
of
light
would
be
fantastically
too
slow
he
proposed
miniature
matter
transmitters
automatically
shuttling
a
magnetic
element
between
ship
and
planet
station
and
back
to
the
ship
again
the
solid
object
conveying
all
the
information
to
be
had
from
the
ship
s
instruments
to
the
planet
station
and
relaying
commands
to
the
ship
s
controls
the
trick
could
have
been
made
to
work
and
it
would
be
vastly
faster
than
any
radiation
beam
but
there
was
no
time
to
manufacture
them
actually
only
four
days
after
the
return
of
the
partly
dismantled
starshine
from
the
farther
side
of
nowhere
kim
took
off
again
from
ades
with
fifty
other
ships
following
him
there
were
twenty
other
similar
squadrons
ready
to
take
space
in
days
more
but
for
a
first
operation
he
insisted
on
a
small
force
to
gain
experience
without
too
much
risk
at
transmitter
speeds
there
could
be
no
such
thing
as
cruising
in
fleet
formation
nor
of
arriving
at
any
destination
in
a
unit
guerilla
warfare
was
inevitable
the
navy
of
the
criminals
of
ades
though
went
swirling
up
through
the
atmosphere
of
that
cold
planet
like
a
column
of
voyaging
wild
geese
it
broke
through
the
upper
atmosphere
and
there
were
all
the
suns
of
the
galaxy
shining
coldly
on
every
hand
the
ships
headed
first
for
khiv
five
lining
up
for
it
with
such
precision
as
the
separate
astrogators
hurriedly
trained
by
kim
could
manage
it
was
a
brave
small
company
of
tiny
ships
forging
through
space
away
from
the
sunlit
little
world
behind
them
the
light
of
the
local
sun
was
bright
upon
their
hulls
glinting
reflections
of
many
colored
stars
shimmered
on
their
shadowed
sides
they
drove
on
and
on
on
planetary
drive
seemingly
motionless
in
space
then
the
starshine
winked
out
of
existence
by
ones
and
twos
and
half
dozens
the
others
vanished
from

it
was
the

drive
of

the
repaired
starshine
vanished
from
space
near
ades
because
it
went
away
from
ades
at
such
speed
that
no
light
could
possibly
be
reflected
from
it
it
reappeared
in
space
within
the
solar
system
of
khiv
because
it
slowed
enough
to
be
visible
but
it
seemed
utterly
alone
yet
presently
an
alarm
gong
rang
and
there
was
one
of
its
sister
ships
a
bare
ten
thousand
miles
away
the
rest
were
scattered
over
parsecs
kim
drove
for
the
banded
planet
on
which
dead
men
still
lay
unburied
his
fleet
was
to
rendezvous
above
its
summer
pole
as
shown
by
the
size
of
the
ice
cap
there
had
been
two
guard
ships
circling
khiv
five
to
keep
account
of
the
development
of
grief
into
despair
dona

robbed
one
of
them
while
its

was
held
helpless
by

of

a
second
had
been
on
the
way
to
its
aid
when
the
starshine
reeled
away
with
the
last
morsel
of
energy
in
its
equalizing
batteries
with
fifty
small
ships
swift
as
gadflies
though
without
a

kim
hoped
to
try
out
the
tactics
planned
for
his
fleet
and
perhaps
to
capture
one
or
both
of
the
giants
he
picked
up
a
third
member
of
his
force
on
the
way
to
the
planet
and
the
three
drove
on

but
as
the

hovered
over
the

cap
of

five
others
came
from
every
direction
then
a
wheezing
voice
bellowed
out
of
the
newly
installed
space
radio
in
the
starshine
s
control
room
it
was
the
voice
of
the
mayor
of

grandly
captaining
a
tiny
ship
with
his
four
tall
sons

da
his

stopped
utterly
kim
snapped
orders
and
his
squadron
came
swarming
after
him
the
direction
of
the
message
was
clear
it
had
come
from
a
point
a
bare
two
thousand
miles
above
the
surface
of
khiv
five
and
with
co
rdinates
which
made
its
location
easy
it
was
too
close
for
the
use
of

even

at

out

the

bare
specks
in

spread
out
and
out
their
battle
tactics
had
been
agreed
upon
they
wove
and
darted
erratically
they
had
projectors
of
the
disciplinary
circuit
field
which
would
paralyze
any
man
they
struck
with
sufficient
intensity
but
that
was
all
for
the
good
and
sufficient
reason
that
such
fields
could
be
tested
upon
grimly
resolute
volunteers
and
adjusted
to
the
utmost
of

on
the
prison

there

killing

there
were
no

the

picked
up
a
single
considerable
mass
electron
telescopes
focussed
upon
it
kim
s
lips
tensed
he
saw
a
giant
war
craft
squat
and
ungainly
with
no
air
resistance
in
space
there
is
no
point
in
streamlining
a
space
ship
and
with
the
look
of
a
mass
of
crammed
generators
of
deadly
beams
it
turned
slowly
in
its
flight
it
was
not
one
space
ship
but
two
two
giant
ships
grappled
together
it
turned
further
and
there
was
a
shimmering
unsubstantial
tiny
shape
clutched
to

the

kim
barked
at
the
mayor
of

even
as
in
the
field
of
the
electron
telescope
he
saw
a
tiny
mote
of
a
space
ship
charge
valorously
at
the
monsters
it
plunged
toward
them
and
vanished
dona
spoke
breathlessly
but
what
happened
kim
this
said
kim
bitterly
is
the
end
of
the
battle
we
fought
with
one
of
those
ships
a
week
ago
we
put
out
a
decoy
and
that
ship
grappled
it
a
disciplinary
circuit
generator
went
on
and
paralyzed
its
crew
you
remember
that
we
went
up
to
it
and
you
went
on
board
i
turned
off
its
generator
from
a
distance
and
held
the
crew
paralyzed
with
beams
from
the
starshine
there
was
another
ship
coming
when
you
got
off
and
we
got
away
to
the
other
side
of
beyond
yes
but
we
vanished
said
kim
the
other
enemy
ship
came
up
its
skipper
must
have
decided
to
go
on
board
the
first
for
a
conference
or
perhaps
to
inspect
the
decoy
it
grappled
to
the
first
and
the
magnetic
surge
turned
on
the
disciplinary
field
again
in
the
gadget
in
the
decoy
every
man
in
both
ships
were
paralyzed
all
over
again
both
ships
were
drifting
with
power
off
they
ve
been
falling
toward
khiv
five
every
man
of
both
crews
must
be
dead
by
now
but
the
field
s
still
on
and
it
will
stay
on
they
ll
crash
but
can
t
we
do
anything
demanded
dona
anxiously
i
know
you
want
a
ship
it
would
be
handy
to
have
those
beams
modified
so
we
could
paralyze
a
planet
from
a
distance
said
kim
grimly
but
these
ships
are
gone
i
could
go
on
board
again
said
dona
no
they
ll
hit
atmosphere
in
minutes
now
and
even
if
we
could
cut
off
the
paralyzing
field
and
get
to
the
control
room
nobody
could
pull
an
unfamiliar
ship
out
of
that
fall
i
wouldn
t
let
you
try
it
anyhow
they
re
falling
fast
miles
a
second
they
ll
hit
with
the
speed
of
a
meteor
but
try
kim
for
answer
he
pulled
her
away
from
the
electron
telescope
and
pointed
through
the
forward
vision
port
the
falling
ships
had
seemed
almost
within
reach
on
the
electron
telescope
screen
but
through
the
vision
port
one
could
see
the
whole
vast
bulk
of
khiv
five
two
thirds
of
it
glowed
brightly
in
sunlight
but
night
had
fallen
directly
below
the
falling
ships
were
the
barest
specks
the
eye
could
possibly
detect
too
far
for
hope
of
overhauling
on
planetary
drive
too
close
to
risk
any
other
any
speed
that
would
overtake
the
derelicts
would
mean
a
crash
against
the
planet
s
disk
i
think
said
kim
they
ll
cross
the
sunset
line
and
fall
in
the
night
area
they
did
they
vanished
as
specks
against
the
sunlit
disk
then
minutes
later
a
little
red
spark
appeared
where
the
bulk
of
the
banded
planet
faded
into
absolute
black
the
spark
held
and
grew
in
brightness
they
ve
hit
atmosphere
kim
told
her
they
re
compressing
the
air
before
them
until
it
s
incandescent
they
re
a
meteoric
fall
the
spark
flared
terribly
minute
though
it
was
from
this
distance
it
curved
downward
as
the
air
slowed
its
forward
speed
it
was
an
infinitesimal
comet
trailing
a
long
tail
of
fire
behind
it
it
swooped
downward
in
a
gracefully
downward
curving
arc
it
crashed
which
said
kim
coldly
in
the
starshine
s
control
room
means
that
two
sinabian
warships
are
destroyed
without
cost
to
us
it
s
a
victory
but
it
s
very
very
bad
luck
for
us
with
those
two
ships
and
transmitter
drive
we
could
end
the
war
in
one
day
ready
for
action
indignantly
the
mayor
of
steadheim
bellowed
from
the
space
phone
speaker
and
kim
answered
him
patiently
the
decoy
still
had
a
disciplinary
circuit
field
on
he
explained
for
the
tenth
time
you
know
about
it
when
you
tried
to
go
galumphing
in
the
field
grabbed
you
and
paralyzed
you
when
your
muscles
went
iron
hard
the
relay
on
your
wrist
you
wear
it
to
protect
you
from
the
fighter
beams
threw
your
ship
into
transmitter
speed
travel
so
you
were
somewhere
else
when
you
came
back
you
charged
in
again
and
the
same
thing
happened
the
relay
protected
you
against
our
field
as
well
as
the
enemy
fighter
beams
that
s
all
the
mayor
wheezed
and
sputtered
furiously
it
was
plain
that
he
had
meant
to
distinguish
himself
and
his
four
sons
by
magnificent
bravery
there
s
something
that
needs
to
be
done
said
kim
those
two
ships
are
smashed
but
they
hadn
t
time
to
melt
there
ll
be
hafnium
in
the
wreckage
anyhow
and
metal
is
scarce
on
ades
see
what
you
can
salvage
and
get
it
to
ades
it
s
important
war
work
ask
for
other
ships
to
volunteer
to
help
you
the
mayor
of
steadheim
roared
indignantly
and
then
consented
like
a
lamb
in
the
space
navy
of
ades
there
would
not
yet
be
anything
like
iron
discipline
kim
led
his
forces
as
a
feudal
baron
might
have
led
a
motley
assemblage
of
knights
and
men
at
arms
in
ancient
days
he
led
by
virtue
of
prestige
and
experience
he
could
not
command
the
fleet
grew
minute
by
minute
as
lost
ships
came
in
and
kim
worked
out
a
new
plan
of
battle
to
meet
the
fact
that
he
could
not
hope
to
appear
over
sinab
with
gigantic
generators
able
to
pour
out
disciplinary
circuit
beams
over
the
whole
planet
he
explained
the
plan
painstakingly
to
his
followers
and
presently
set
a
course
for
sinab
a
surprising
number
of
ships
volunteered
to
go
to
ground
on
khiv
five
with
the
mayor
of
steadheim
to
save
what
could
be
retrieved
of
the
shattered
two
warships
no
more
than
thirty
little
craft
of
ades
pointed
their
noses
toward
sinab
they
went
speeding
toward
it
in
a
close
knit
group
matching
courses
to
almost
microscopic
accuracy
and
keeping
their
speed
identical
to
a
hair
in
hopes
of
arriving
nearly
in
one
group
so
we
ll
try
it
again
said
kim
into
the
space
phone
here
we
go
he
pressed
the
transmitter
drive
button
and
all
the
universe
danced
a
momentary
saraband
and
far
off
to
the
left
the
giant
sun
sinab
glowed
fiercely
five
of
the
little
ships
from
ades
were
within
detector
range
but
there
were
four
monstrous
moving
masses
which
by
their
motion
and
velocity
were
space
ships
rising
from
the
planet
and
setting
out
upon
some
errand
of
the
murder
empire
the
same
thought
must
have
come
instantly
to
those
upon
each
of
the
little
ships
they
charged
there
had
been
no
war
in
space
for
five
thousand
years
the
last
space
battle
was
that
of
canis
major
when
forty
thousand
warships
plunged
toward
each
other
with
their
fighting
beams
stabbing
out
savagely
aimed
and
controlled
by
every
device
that
human
ingenuity
could
contrive
that
battle
had
ended
wars
for
all
time
the
galaxy
believed
because
there
was
no
survivor
on
either
side
in
seconds
every
combatant
ship
was
merely
a
mass
of
insensate
metal
which
fought
on
in
a
blind
futility
the
fighting
beams
killed
in
thousandths
of
seconds
the
robot
gunners
aimed
with
absolute
precision
the
two
fleets
joined
battle
and
the
robots
fixed
their
targets
and
every
ship
became
a
coffin
in
which
all
living
things
were
living
no
longer
which
yet
fought
on
with
beams
which
could
do
no
further
harm
with
every
man
in
both
fleets
dead
the
warships
raged
through
emptiness
pouring
out
destruction
from
their
unmanned
projectors
it
was
a
hundred
years
before
the
last
war
craft
its
fuel
gone
and
its
crew
mere
dust
was
captured
and
destroyed
but
there
had
been
no
space
fight
since
until
now
and
this
one
was
strangeness
itself
four
huge
squat
ships
of
war
rose
steadily
from
the
planet
sinab
two
they
were
doubtless
bound
on
a
mission
of
massacre
the
empire
of
sinab
gave
no
warning
of
its
purpose
it
did
not
permit
the
option
of
submission
its
ships
headed
heavily
out
into
space
crammed
with
generators
of
the
murder
frequency

it
took

they
were
just
beginning

stream
up
into
emptiness
again
when
the
first
of
the

flashed
back
into

this

it
was
ready
for

its

flared
thin
streams
of

that
were
visible
even
in

the

plunged
for
it
in
masses
the

flared
terribly
and
the

vanished
diving
for

plunging
for

raging
toward

with
every
appearance
of
deadly
assault
they
flicked
into

when
the
deadly

touched
them
because
the
crews
of
every

were
fitted
with
the

the

flung

the

recklessly

happened
they
feared

but
it
hadn

the
fleet
of
ades
had
bombed
the
enemy
planet
to
be
sure
but
in
a
quite
unprecedented
fashion
they
had
simply
dropped
small
round
cases
containing
apparatus
which
was
very
easily
made
and
to
which
not
even
the
most
conscientious
of
the
exiles
on

could
object
they
were
tiny
broadcasting
units
very
much
like
one
kim
had
put
in
a
decoy
ship
which
gave
off
the
neuronic
frequencies
of
the
disciplinary
circuit
tuned
to

the
cases
were
seamless
spheres
made
of
an
alloy
that
could
only
be
formed
by
powder
metallurgy
and
could
not
be
melted
or
pierced
at
all
it
was
the
hardest
substance
developed
in
thirty
thousand
years
of
civilization
and
at
least
one
of
those
cases
had
been
dropped
on
every
large
city
of
sinab
two
and
when
they
struck
they
began
to
broadcast
pitched
battle
every
man
in
every
city
of
the
capital
planet
of
the
empire
was
instantly
struck
motionless
from
the
gross
and
corpulent
emperor
himself
down
to
the
least
considered
scoundrel
of
each
city
s
slums
every
man
felt
his
every
muscle
go
terribly
and
impossibly
rigid
every
man
was
helpless
and
convulsed
and
the
women
were
unaffected
on
sinab
two
which
was
the
capital
of
a
civilization
which
considered
women
inferior
animals
the
women
had
not
been
encouraged
to
be
intelligent
for
a
long
time
they
were
merely
bewildered
they
were
afraid
to
try
to
do
anything
to
assist
their
men
those
with
small
boy
children
doubtless
were
the
first
to
dare
to
use
their
brains
it
was
unquestionably
the
mother
of
a
small
boy
gone
terribly
motionless
who
desperately
set
out
in
search
of
help
she
reasoned
fearfully
that
since
her
own
city
was
full
of
agonized
statues
which
were
men
perhaps
in
another
city
there
might
be
aid
she
tremblingly
took
a
land
car
and
desperately
essayed
to
convey
her
son
to
where
something
might
be
done
for
him
and
she
found
that
in
the
open
space
beyond
the
city
he
recovered
from
immobility
to
a
mere
howling
discomfort
as
the
city
was
left
farther
behind
he
became
increasingly
less
unhappy
and
at
last
was
perfectly
normal
but
it
must
have
been
hours
before
that
discovery
became
fully
known
so
that
mothers
took
their
boy
children
beyond
the
range
of
the
small
cases
dropped
from
the
skies
and
then
wives
dutifully
loaded
their
helpless
husbands
upon
land
cars
or
into
freight
conveyors
and
so
got
them
out
to
where
they
could
rage
in
unbridled
fury
the
emperor
and
his
court
were
probably
last
of
all
to
be
released
from
the
effects
of
the
disciplinary
circuit
broadcasts
by
mere
distance
the
empire
was
reduced
to
chaos
for
fifty
miles
about
every

it
was
impossible
for
any
man
to
move
a
muscle
for
seventy

it
was

no
man

go

the
small

dropped
from
the

her
sister

experiencing
active
discomfort
obviously
the
cities
housed
the
machinery
of

the

which
the

even

upon
comfortable
soft
couches
for
the
very
means
of
living
they
were
dependent
upon
the
favor
of
women
because
women
were
free
to
go
anywhere
and
do
anything
while
men
had
to
stay
in
the
open
fields
like
cattle
the
foundation
of
the
civilization
of
greater
sinab
was
shattered
because
women
abruptly
ceased
to
be
merely
inferior
animals
the
defenses
of
that
one
planet
were
non
existent
and
even
the
four

just
taken
off
went
down
recklessly
to
the
seemingly
unharmed
cities
to

with
monstrous
crashes

every

in

helpless
the

out

but
the
disciplinary

which
made

absolute
by
the
most
trivial

became
a
device

very
high

sufficed
for
the
conquest
of
a

days
when
the
human
race
was
rising
but
even
thirty
light

at
that
rate

six

when
the

they

the

hurtling
on
they
could
have
been
missiles
they
traveled
at
miles
per

but
meteor
repellers
flung
them
contemptuously
aside
once
they
were
no
longer
parts
of
space
craft
with
drive
in

the
little

tried
to

that

impossible
they
could
do
nothing
but
make
threatening
dashes
and
the
giants
went
on
toward
ades
from
forty
million
miles
to
thirty
millions
the
enemy
squadron
drove
on

its
tiny
antagonists
darting

to
flee
ahead
to

give
warning
and
take
on
board
what
refugees
they
could
but
there
were
nineteen
million
souls
on
ades
at
most
a
million
had
crowded
through
to
terranova
in
the
second
galaxy
and
they
could
do
next
to
nothing
at
twenty
millions
of
miles
some
of
the
midgets
were
back
with
cases
of
chemical
explosive
they
strewed
them
in
the
paths
of
the
juggernaut
ships
with
no
velocity
of
their
own
almost
stationary
in
space
someone
had
thought
they
might
not
activate
the
sinabian
repellers
but
that
thought
was
futile
the
repeller
beams
stabbed
at
them
with
the
force
of
collisions
the
chemical
explosives
flashed
luridly
in
emptiness
and
made
swift
expanding
clouds
of
vapor
of
the
tenuity
of
comets

the
enemy
ships
came
on
at
ten
million
miles
two
unmanned
ships
guided
by
remote
control
flashed
furiously
toward
the
leading
war
craft
they
at
least
should
be
able
to
ram
repeller
beams
which
focused
upon
them
were
neutralized
by
the
space
torpedoes
drives
they
drove
in
frenziedly
but
as
they
drew
closer
the
power
of
the
repeller
beams
rose
to
incredible
heights
and
overwhelmed
the
power
of
the
little
ships
engines
and
shorted
the
field
generating
coils
and
blew
out
the
motors
and
the
guided
missiles
were
hurled
away
broken
hulks
the
fleet
reached
a
mere
five
million
miles
from
the
planet
ades
its
separate
members
had
come
to
realize
their
invincibility
against
all
the
assaults
that
could
be
made
against
them
by
the
defending
forces
unexpected
as
they
were
of
this
small
world
the
fleet
divided
to
take
up
appropriate
stations
above
the
planet
and
direct
their
projectors
of
annihilation
downward
they
would
wipe
out
every
living
male
upon
the
planet
s
surface
they
would
do
it
coldly
remorselessly
without
emotion
presently
the
planet
would
become
part
of
an
empire
which
in
fact
had
ceased
to
function
the
action
of
the
fleet
would
not
only
be
horrible
it
would
be
futile
but
its
personnel
could
not
know
that
the
giant
ships
took
position
and
began
to
descend
odd
little
blue
white
glows
appeared
in
the
atmosphere
far
below
they
seemed
quite
useless
those
blue
white
glows
the
only
effect
that
could
at
once
be
ascribed
to
them
was
the
sudden
vanishing
of
a
dozen
little
ships
preparing
to
make
for
the
hundredth
time
despairing
dashes
at
the
monsters
those
little
ships
winked
out
of
existence
gone
into
transmitter
drive
and
then
the
big
ships
wavered
in
their
flight
automatic
controls
seemed
to
take
hold
they
checked
in
their
descent
and
presently
were
motionless
a
roar
of
triumph
came
to

from

in

you

to
salvage
the
two
ships
that
crashed
there
they
bounced
when
they
landed
they
shook
themselves
apart
and
spilled
themselves
in
little
pieces
instead
of
smashing
to
powder
we
picked
up
half
a
dozen
projectors
that
could
be
repaired
all
neatly
tuned
to
kill
men
and
leave

unharmed
we
brought
em
back

em
brought
em
here
with

for
my
four

a
promise
of
vengeance
for
the
other
women
whose
men
were
murdered
we
just
gave
these
devils
a
dose
of
the
medicine
they

for

those

eased

down
through
the

of
the
two
terranovan
moons
to
the
matted
lawn
outside
his
homestead
in
the

a
figure
started
up
from

and
hurried
down
to
greet
him
as
he
opened
the
exit

and
helped
dona
to
the

s
this
asked

in
the
darkness
after
the
lighted
interior
of

who
it
s
me
kim
rendell
said
the
colony
organizer
for

he
sounded
unhappy
and
full
of
forebodings
we
ve
been
doing
all
we
can
to
take
care
of
the
crowds
who
came
through
the
matter
transmitter
but
it
was
a
difficult
task
a
difficult
task
now
the
crowd
of
new
colonists
has
dropped
to
a
bare
trickle
every
one
has
a
different
story
i
was
told
though
that
you
were
coming
back
in
the
starshine
and
could
advise
me
i
need
your
advice
kim
rendell
the
situation
may
be
terrible
kim
led
the
way
to
the
terrace
of
his
house
i
wouldn
t
say
it
will
be
terrible
he
said
cheerfully
enough
it
s
good
to
get
back
home
dona
i
want
to
look
inside
said
dona
firmly
she
went
within
to
satisfy
the
instinct
of
every
woman
who
has
been
away
from
home
to
examine
all
her
dwelling
jealously
on
her
return
kim
stretched
himself
out
in
a
chair
the
stars
unnamed
unexplored
and
infinitely
promising
of
all
the
second
galaxy
twinkled
overhead
terranova
s
two
moons
floated
serenely
across
the
sky
and
the
strange
soft
scents
of
the
night
came
to
his
nostrils
kim
sniffed
luxuriously
ah
this
is
good
he
said
zestfully
but
what
s
happened
demanded
the
colony
organizer
anxiously
in
three
weeks
we
had
four
hundred
thousand
new
arrivals
through
the
transmitter
most
of
them
were
children
and
boys
then
the
flood
stopped
like
that
what
are
we
to
do
about
them
did
you
get
fuel
for
your
ship
i
understand
the
danger
from
sinab
is
over
but
we
find
it
hard
to
get
information
from
ades
everyone
there
everyone
there
is
busy
said
kim
comfortably
you
see
we
smashed
the
empire
without
killing
more
than
a
very
few
men
on
sinab
two
where
the
empire
was
started
we
chased
the
men
out
of
the
cities
and
put
them
at
the
mercy
of
the
women
so
many
men
had
emigrated
to
the
planets
whose
men
had
been
killed
off
that
there
was
a
big
disproportion
even
on
sinab
and
the
women
were
not
pleased
they
d
been
badly
treated
too
we
didn
t
approve
of
the
men
though
we
gave
them
their
choice
of
emigrating
to
a
brand
new
world
with
only
such
women
as
chose
to
go
with
them
or
of
being
wiped
out
they
chose
to
emigrate
so
half
the
technical
men
on
ades
have
been
busy
supervising
their
emigration
not
to
here
asked
the
colony
organizer
in
alarm
we
can
t
feed
ourselves
yet
no
not
to
here
said
kim
drily
they
went
to
a
place
we
scouted
accidentally
in
the
starshine
they
re
not
likely
to
come
back
i
left
a
matter
receiver
there
and
when
they
ve
all
gone
through
it
all
the
men
from
twenty
planets
with
what
women
want
to
go
with
them
we
ll
smash
that
receiver
and
they
ll
be
on
their
own
they
re
quite
a
long
way
off
three
hundred
billion
light
years
more
or
less
they
re
not
likely
to
come
in
contact
with
our
descendants
for
several
million
years
yet
by
that
time
they
ll
either
be
civilized
or
else
the
colony
organizer
asked
questions
in
a
worried
tone
kim
answered
them
but
twenty
one
planets
with
no
men
on
them
said
the
organizer
worriedly
these
women
will
all
want
to
come
here
not
quite
all
there
were
ten
men
on
ades
for
every
woman
a
lot
of
them
will
settle
on
the
twenty
planets
where
the
proportion
is
reversed
a
surprising
lot
will
want
to
move
on
to
the
second
galaxy
though
but
we
ll
be
ready
for
them
said
kim
we
ve
space
ships
enough
for
exploration
now
the
mayor
of
steadheim
wants
a
planet
for
each
of
his
four
sons
to
colonize
they
picked
up
wives
on
khiv
five
and
want
to
get
away
from
the
old
chap
and
indulge
in
a
little
domesticity
and
there
ll
be
plenty
of
others
he
added
we
ve
some
big
war
craft
to
bring
over
too
in
case
there
s
any
dangerous
animals
or
entities
here
but
said
the
colony
organizer
again
we
re
sending
ships
through
the
first
galaxy
too
said
kim
to
do
a
little
missionary
work
after
all
twenty
one
planets
are
without
men
so
the
starshine
s
sister
ships
will
drop
down
secretly
on
one
planet
after
another
to
start
whisperings
that
a
man
who
s
sent
to
ades
is
a
pretty
lucky
man
if
he
has
courage
and
brains
he
s
better
off
than
living
as
a
human
sheep
under
kings
or
technarchs
who
ll
clap
the
disciplinary
circuit
on
him
if
he
thinks
for
himself
there
ll
be
more
criminals
and
rebels
than
usual
from
now
on
the
flow
of
men
who
are
not
quite
sheep
will
increase
with
three
hundred
million
planets
to
draw
from
and
the
way
whispers
pass
from
world
to
world
the
adventurous
spirits
will
start
getting
themselves
sent
to
ades
there
ll
be
planets
for
them
to
move
to
and
women
to
marry
and
a
leaven
of
hardy
souls
to
teach
them
that
being
a
free
man
is
pretty
good
fun
we
won
t
make
an
empire
of
those
twenty
one
planets
just
a
refuge
for
every
man
with
backbone
in
all
the
galaxy
the
colony
organizer
looked
worried
but
there
are
terranova
and
the
second
galaxy
waiting
to
be
explored
and
colonized
maybe
they
ll
be
satisfied
to
stay
there
kim
laughed
when
he
ceased
to
laugh
he
chuckled
i
m
here
i
ve
got
a
wife
do
you
suppose
that
any
woman
will
want
her
husband
to
stay
on
one
of
those
twenty
one
planets
for
years
to
come
where
women
outnumber
men
where
well
a
man
with
a
roving
eye
sees
plenty
of
women
about
for
his
eyes
to
rove
to
the

organizer
still
worried
nevertheless
until
dona
came
out
from
the
inside
of
the
house
she
had
assured
herself
that
everything
was
intact
and
her
mind
was
at
rest
she
brought
refreshments
for
kim
and
their
guest
i
was
just
saying
said
kim
that
i
thought
there
would
still
be
plenty
of
people
coming
from
ades
and
the
twenty
one
planets
to
terranova
and
to
settle
on
the
new
worlds
as
they
re
opened
up
of
course
said
dona
i
wouldn
t
live
there
any
normal
woman
when
she
has
a
husband
will
want
to
move
where
he
ll
be
safe
and
she
might
have
been
referring
to
the
holocausts
on
those
planets
caused
by
the
death
beams
of
the
dead
sinabian
empire
but
even
the

did
not
think
so
part

the

circuit
damaged
transmitter
kim
rendell
had
almost
forgotten
that
he
was
ever
a
matter
transmitter
technician
but
then
the
matter
transmitter
on
terranova
ceased
to
operate
and
they
called
on
him
it
happened
just
like
that
one
instant
the
wavering
silvery
film
seemed
to
stretch
across
the
arch
in
the
public
square
of

still
small

galaxy
the
film
bulged
and
momentarily
seemed
to
form
the
outline
of
a
human
figure
as
a
totally
reflecting
pulsating
cocoon
about
a
moving
object
then
it
broke
like
a
bubble
film
and
a
walking
figure
stepped
unconcernedly
out
instantly
the
silvery
film
was
formed
again
behind
it
and
another
shape
developed
on
the
film
s
surface
only
seconds
before
these
people
and
these
objects
had
been
on
another
planet
in
another
island
universe
across
unthinkable
parsecs
of
space
now
they
were
here
bales
and
bundles
and
parcels
of
merchandise
huge
containers
of
foodstuffs
the
colony
on
terranova
was
still
not
completely
self
sustaining
and
drums
of
fuel
for
the
space
ships
busy
mapping
the
new
galaxy
for
the
use
of
men
and
more
people
and
a
huge
tank
of
viscous
opalescent
plastic
then
came
a
pretty
girl
smiling
brightly
on
her
first
appearance
on
a
new
planet
in
a
new
universe
and
crates
of
castings
for
more
space
ships
and
a
family
group
with
a
pet
zorag
on
a
leash
behind
them
and
a
batch
of
cryptic
pieces
of
machinery
and
a
man
then
nothing
without
fuss
the
silvery
film
ceased
to
be
one
could
look
completely
through
the
archway
which
was
the
matter
transmitter
one
could
see
what
was
on
the
other
side
instead
of
a
wavering
pulsating
reflection
of
objects
nearby
the
last
man
to
come
through
spoke
unconcernedly
over
his
shoulder
to
someone
he
evidently
believed
just
behind
but
who
was
actually
now
separated
from
him
by
the
abyss
between
island
universes
and
some
thousands
of
parsecs
beyond
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
matter
transmitters
ordinarily
they
had
been
in

for
ten
thousand
years
all
the
commerce
of
the
first

now
moved
through
them
space
ships
had
become
obsolete
and
the
little
starshine
which
was
the
first
handiwork
of
man
to
cross
the
gulf
to
the
second
galaxy
had
been
a
museum
exhibit
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
before
kim
rendell
smashed
out
of
the
museum
in
it
with
dona
and
the
two
of
them
went
roaming
hopelessly
among
the
ancient
decaying
civilizations
of
man
s
first
home
in
quest
of
a
world
in
which
they
could
live
in
freedom
but
the
matter
transmitter
had
ceased
to

five
millions
of
human
beings
in
the
second

isolated
from
the
first
ades
was
the
only
planet
in
the
home
galaxy
on
which
all
men
were
criminals
by
definition
and
hence
were
friendly
to
the
people
of
the
new
settlements
every
single
other
planet
save
the
bewildered
and
almost
manless
planets
which
had
been
subject
to
sinab
was
a
tyranny
of
one
brutal
variety
or
another
every
other
planet
regarded
the
men
of
ades
as
outlaws
rebels
and
criminals
the
people
of
terranova
therefore
were
not
cut
off
from
the
immigrants
and
supplies
and
the
technical
skills
of
ades
they
were
necessarily
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
human
race

then
besides
that
there
were
sixteen
millions
of

on

off
from

immediately
the

went
in

to

to
bewail
kim

was
peacefully
puttering
with
an
unimportant
small
gadget
when
the
colony

arrived
the
house
was
something
of
a
gem
of
polished
plastic
dona

designed
it
and
it
stood
on
a
hill
with
a
view
which
faced
the
morning
sun
and
the
rising
twin
moons
of
terranova
the
atmosphere
flier
descended
and
dona
led
the
organizer
to
the
workshop
in
which
kim
puttered
the
organizer
had
had
half
an
hour
in
which
to
think
of
catastrophe
he
was
in
a
deplorable
state
when
kim
looked
up
from
the
thing
with
which
he
was
tinkering

and
welcome
he
said
cheerfully
in
the
formal
greeting
i
m
only
amusing
myself
but
you
look
disturbed
the
colony
organizer
bewailed
the
fact
that
there
would
be
no
more

no
more

technical
information

supplies

necessary
for

and
new
building
machines
were
desperately
in

and
the
storage
reserves
were
depleted
and
could
last
only
so
long
if
no
more

through
but
said
kim
blankly
why
shouldn
t
they
come
through
the

stopped

the

wrung
his

of

the
precious
material
that

said
kim
a
transmitter
and
a
receiver
are
a
unit
both
have
to
work
for
either
one
to
operate
except
in
the
very
special
case
of
a
transmitter
drive
ship
but
it
s
queer
i
ll
come
take
a
look
he
slipped
into
the
conventional
out
of

listened
now
she
said
a
word

two
to

kim
s
expression
darkened
that
s
what
i
m
afraid
of
he
told
her
a
transmitter
is
too
simple
to
break
down
they
can
get
detuned
but
we
made
the
pairs
for
ades
and
terranova
especially
their
tuning
elements
are
set
in
solid
plastite
they
couldn
t
get
out
of
tune
he
picked
up
a
small
box
he
tucked
it
under
his
arm
i
ll
be
back
he
told
dona
heavily
but
i
suspect
you
d
better
pack
he
went
out
to
the
grounded
flier
the
colony
organizer
took
it
up
and
across
the
green
clad
hills
of
terranova
the
vegetation
of
terranova
is
extraordinarily
flexible
and
the
green
stuff
below
the
flier
swayed
elaborately
in
the
wind
the
top
of
the
forests
bowed
and
bent
in
the
form
of
billows
and
waves
the
effect
was
that
of
an
ocean
which
complacently
remained
upraised
in
hillocks
and
had
no
normal
surface
it
was
not
easy
to
get
used
to
such
things
i
m
terribly
worried
said
the
organizer
anxiously
there
is
a
tremendous
shortage
of
textiles
and
the
ores
we
usually
send
back
to
balance
our
account
are
piling
up
you
re
badly
worried
eh
said
kim
grimly
of
course
how
can
we
keep
our
economic
system
now
kim
made
an
angry
noise
i
m
a
lot
more
worried
than
you
are
he
snapped
nothing
should
have
stopped
this
particular
pair
of
transmitters
from
working
but
the
destruction
of
one
or
the
other
this
box
in
my
pocket
might
tell
me
the
answer
but
i
m
afraid
to
find
out
i
assure
you
that
temporary
surpluses
and
shortages
of
ores
and
textiles
are
the
least
of
the
things
we
have
to
worry
about
the
little
flier
sped
on
with
the
great
waving
billows
of
the
forest
beneath
it
on
one
hillock
there
was
a
clearing
with
a
group
of
four
plastic
houses
shining
in
the
sunlight
they
looked
horribly
lonely
in
the
sea
of
green
but
the
population
on
terranova
was
spread
thin
far
over
at
the
horizon
there
was
another
clearing
sunlight
glinted
on
water
a
pleasure
pool
there
was
a
sizable
village
about
it
half
a
dozen
soarers
spun
and
whirled
lazily
above
kim
said
the
thing
is
that
ades
and
the
planets
left
over
after
we
handled
sinab
are
the
only
places
in
the
whole
first
galaxy
where
there
are
no
disciplinary
circuits
ades
is
the
only
place
where
a
man
can
spit
in
the
eye
of
another
man
and
the
two
of
them
settle
it
between
themselves
there

a
government
of
sorts
on

as
there

here
but
there
s
no
ruler
also
there
s
nobody
who
can
strut
around
and
make
other
men
bow
to
him
a
woman
on

and
here

to
the
man
she
wants
to
belong
to
she
can
t
be
seized
by
some
lordling
for
his
own
pleasure
and
turned
over
to
his
guards
and
underlings
when
he
s
through
with
her
that
s
true
said
the
colony
organizer
who
was
still
worried
but
the
transmitter
gossip
of
the
admirable
state
of
things
on
ades
has
gone
about
said
kim
hardly
some
of
our
young
men
appointed
themselves
missionaries
and
went
roaming
around
the
planets
spreading
word
that
ades
wasn
t
a
bad
place
that
if
you
were
exiled
to
ades
you
were
lucky
they
probably
bragged
that
we
whipped
the
empire
of
sinab
in
a
fight
at
this
the
mouth
of
the
organizer
dropped
open
in
astonishment
of
course
of
course
the
number
of
exiles
arriving
at
ades
increased
it
was
excellent
we
need
people
for
the
second
galaxy
and
people
who
earn
exile
are
usually
people
with
courage
willing
to
take
risks
for
the
sake
of
hope
don
t
you
realize
that
such
things
have
been
dangerous
when
people
on
markab
two
began
to
hope
kim
said
impatiently
when
peasants
on
the
planets
of
allioth
began
to
imagine
that
things
might
be
better
when
slaves
on
utbeg
began
to
tell
each
other
in
murmurs
that
there
was
a
place
where
people
weren
t
slaves
don
t
you
see
that
such
things
would
alarm
the
rulers
of
such
planets
how
can
people
be
held
as
slaves
unless
you
keep
them
in

the
colony
organizer
corrected
his
course
a
trifle
far
away
the
walls
of
the

city
of

glinted
in

there

the
twenty

the
subject
of
dreams
peasants

commoners

of
it
yearningly
as
a
sort

tyrants
dream
of
it
either
as
a
nightmare
which
threatens
the
tranquility

or
else
as
a
very
pretty
bit
of
loot
to
be
seized
if
possible
there
are
probably
ten
thousand
royal
courts
where
ambitious

rack
their

for
some
plausible
way
to
wipe

the

it
was
the
largest

on

then
you
think
said
the
harassed

that
some
outrage
has
been
committed
and
the

damaged
perhaps
by

there

went
along
a

walk
to
the
central

many

standing
motionless
looking
at
the
tall

have
been
nothing
extraordinary
about
the
appearance
of
the
arch
to
a

from
past
ages
it
would
have
seemed
to
be
quite
commonplace
gracefully
designed
to
be
sure

with
a
smooth
purity
of

which
the
ancient

only
aspired

the

at
the
base
of
the
arch
the
local
matter
technician
greeted
him
with
relief
i
m
glad
you
have
come
kim
rendell
he
said
uneasily
i
can
find
nothing
wrong
every
circuit
is
correct
every
contact
is
sound
but
it
simply
does
not
work
i
ll
see
said
kim
i
m
sure
you
are
right
but
i
ll
verify
it
yet
i
m
afraid
i
m
only
postponing
a
test
i
should
have
made
before
he
went
over
the
test
panel
trying
the
various
circuits
all
checked
up
satisfactorily
he
went
behind
the
test
panel
and
switched
a
number
of
leads
he
returned
to
the
front
and
worked
the
panel
again
the
results
were
widely
at
variance
with
the
original
readings
but
kim
regarded
them
with
an
angry
acceptance
i
reversed
some
leads
just
in
case
a
checking
instrument
was
out
by
the
same
amount
as
a
circuit
he
told
the
technician
to
be
frank
about
it
i
made
sure
you
hadn
t
knocked
out
the
transmitter
on
purpose
such
things
have
been
done
then
he
said
grimly
this
one
is
all
right
the
transmitter
on
ades
is
out
of
action
it
not
only
doesn
t
work
but
they
haven
t
been
able
to
fix
it
in
how
long
two
hours
now
said
the
technician
unhappily
too
long
said
kim
he
unpacked
his
box
it
was
very
small
a
foot
by
a
foot
by
a
foot
there
was
a
cone
shaped
hole
in
one
end
which
diminished
to
a
small
hole
at
the
other
end
kim
sweated
a
little
i
should
have
tried
this
before
he
said
but
i
wanted
to
hope
with
all
the
first
galaxy
fearing
and
hating
ades
somebody
would
think
of
a
way
to
do
us
damage
even
without
space
ships
he
turned
a
tiny
knob
on
the
box
and
looked
through
the
hole
his
lips
tautened
he
began
to
make
tests
his
face
grew
more
and
more
drawn
and
sombre
at
last
he
turned
the
little
knob
again
and
nothing
happened
his
face
went
quite
white
what
is
it
asked
the
colony
organizer
kim
sat
down
looking
rather
sick
it
s
bad
he
said
then
he
gestured
toward
the
box
when
we
were
fighting
sinab
somebody
worked
out
an
idea
for
the
remote
control
of
ships
beam
control
would
be
too
slow
at
a
few
million
miles
the
information
the
robot
gathered
would
take
seconds
to
get
back
to
the
control
board
and
more
seconds
would
be
needed
for
the
controlling
signals
to
get
back
to
the
robot
in
terms
of
light
years
communications
that
way
would
be
impossible
kim
glanced
at
the
organizer
who
signified
by
a
nod
that
he
understood
if
it
took
a
year
each
way
there
d
be
two
years
between
the
robot
s
observation
of
something
to
be
acted
on
kim
continued
and
the
signal
that
would
make
it
act
so
this
man
proposed
very
tiny
matter
transmitters
one
on
the
robot
and
one
on
the
home
planet
a
solid
object
would
receive
all
the
information
the
robot
s
instruments
gathered
the
transmitter
would
send
it
back
to
the
control
board
at
transmitter
speed
and
the
board
would
impress
orders
on
it
and
send
it
to
the
robot
again
it
could
shuttle
across
the
width
of
a
galaxy
a
hundred
times
a
second
and
make
robot
control
at
any
distance
practical
a
few
of
them
were
made
but
not
used
this
is
one
of
them
i
had
it
for
measuring
the
actual
speed
of
transmitter
travel
between
here
and
ades
we
thought
the
distance
would
be
enough
for
a
good
measurement
it
wasn
t
but
this
is
a
transmitter
like
the
big
one
and
it
has
a
mate
on
ades
and
its
mate
is
a
hemisphere
away
from
ades
main
transmitter
and
neither
one
works
something
s
happened
on
ades
that
involves
both
hemispheres
and
the
transmitter
couldn
t
have
been
knocked
out
by
something
that
only
killed
people
it
looks
as
if
ades
may
have
been
destroyed
there
was
an
instant
s
uncomprehending
silence
then
the
realization
struck
home
in
all
of
human
history
no
planet
had
ever
been
completely
destroyed
dozens
even
hundreds
had
been
devastated
before
wars
came
to
an
end
by
the
discovery
of
a
weapon
too
terrible
to
be
used
four
had
been
depopulated
by
that
weapon
the
fighting
beam
but
never
before
had
it
even
been
imagined
that
a
planet
could
be
wiped
out
of
existence
there
are
theoretic
considerations
said
kim
dry
throated
which
make
a
material
weapon
like
atomic
explosive
unthinkable
there
are
other
considerations
which
make
it
certain
that
any
immaterial
weapon
that
could
destroy
a
planet
would
have
infinite
speed
and
therefore
infinite
range
if
ades
has
been
destroyed
all
the
human
race
including
us
must
sooner
or
later
be
subject
to
those
who
control
such
a
weapon
kim
rendell
paused
and
cleared
his
throat
if
they
start
off
by
destroying
the
only
world
on
which
men
are
free
i
don
t
think
i
like
it
now
i
must
go
back
home
i
d
better
get
over
to
the
first
galaxy
in
the
starshine
and
find
out
what
s
happened
the
thousand
million
suns
of
the
first
galaxy

in

by
their
families
of

three
hundred
million

been

by
the
human

for
thirty
thousand

the
descendants
of
the

of

that
almost
mythical
first

of
humanity

spread
through
the
vastness
of
what
once
had
seemed
to
them
the
very
cosmos
itself
in
the
older
long
settled
planets
civilization
rose
to
incredible
heights
of
luxury
and
of
pride
and
then
took
the
long
dive
down
into
decadence
and
futility
while
newer
fresher
worlds
still
struggled
upward
from
the
status
of
frontier
settlements
but
at
long
last
humanity
s
task
in
the
first
galaxy

ended
the
last
planet

the

reached
the
limit
of
its
growth
it
had
reached

so
it
seemed
its
highest
possible
point
of
development
matter
transmitters
conveyed
parcels
and
persons
instantly
and
easily
from

disciplinary
circuits
enforced
the
laws
of
planetary
governments
beyond
any
hope
of
evasion
or
defiance
there
were
impregnable
defenses
against

from

there
could
be
no
war
there
could
be
no
revolt
there
could
be
no
successful
crime
save
by
those
people
who
controlled
governments
and
there
could
be
no
hope
so
humanity
settled
back
toward
barbarism
perhaps
it
was
inevitable
that
conquest
should
again
become
possible

once
more
feasible
even

perhaps
it

the
most
natural

leap
near
that
preposterous
group
of
the
blue
white
suns
of

whose
complicated
orbits
about
each

still
puzzled

kim
had
come
to
the
sector
of
the

he
desired
on
his
second
leap
and
to
the
star
cluster
in
the
third
and
the
fourth
brought
him
to
the
small
sun
he
looked
for
but
space
was
empty
about
it
a
sun
without
planets
is
a
rarity
so
strange
that
it
is
almost
impossible
this
sun

possessed
ades
nevertheless
kim
searched
for
ades
he
found
nothing
he
searched
for
debris
of
an
exploded
planet
he
found
nothing
he
set
cameras
to
photograph
all
the
cosmos
about
him
and
drove
the
starshine
at
highest
interplanetary
speed
for
twelve
hours
then
he
looked
at
the

twelve

not
have
their
angles
change
appreciably
and
so
would
show
upon
the
plates
as
definite
tiny
dots
but
any
planet
or
any
debris
within
a
thousand
million
miles
would
make
a
streak
instead
of
a
dot
upon
the
photographic
plate
there
was
nothing
ades

vanished
he
aimed
for
the
star
khiv
and
flashed
to
its
vicinity
the
banded
planet
khiv

sedately
in
emptiness
kim
drove
for

at

on
the

at

strangely
a

ship
which
landed
on
khiv
five
or
anywhere
else
for
that
matter
must
certainly
come
from

but
ships
were
not
commonplace
sights
kim
was
no
commonplace
sight
either
six
years
before
the

in
quest
of

had
remained
to

the

with

through

they
looked
at

with
veiled

on
an
exclusively
feminine
world
does
strange
things
to

there
were
women
wearing
the
badges
of
mourning
for
husbands
dead
more
than
half
a
decade
in
a
sense
it
was
a
dramatization
of
their
loss
because
all
women
everywhere
take
a
melancholy
pleasure
in
the
display
of
their
unhappiness
but
in
part
to
boast
of
grief
for
a
lost
husband
was
an
excuse
for
not
having
captured
one
of
the
few
men
who
had
arrived
since
the
mass
murder

kim

its

swarmed
with
women
he
asked
for
the
head
of
the
planet
government
and
at
long
last
found
an
untidy
woman
at
a
desk
he
asked
what
was
known
of
ades
i
was
on
terranova
he
explained
the
matter
transmitter
went
off
and
it
did
not
come
back
on
i
came
back
by
space
ship
to
find
out
about
it
and
went
to
where
ades
should
have
been
i
m
kim
rendell
and
i
used
to
be
a
matter
transmitter
technician
i
thought
i
might
repair
the
one
on
ades
if
it
needed
repairing
but
i
could
find
no
planet
circling
ades
sun
the
woman
regarded
him
with
what
was
almost
hostility
kim
rendell
she
said
i
ve
heard
of
you
you
are
a
very
famous
man
but
we
women
on
khiv
five
can
do
without
men
no
doubt
kim
said
patiently
but
has
there
been
any
word
of
ades
we
are
not
interested
in
ades
she
said
angrily
we
can
do
without
ades
but
i
m
interested
in
ades
said
kim
and
after
all
it
was
ades
which
punished
the
murderers
of
the
men
of
khiv
five
a
certain
amount
of
gratitude
is
indicated
gratitude
said
the
untidy
woman
harshly
we
d
have
been
grateful
if
you
men
of
ades
had
turned
those
sinabians
over
to
us
we
d
have
killed
them
every
one
slowly
but
the
point
is
said
kim
that
something
has
happened
to
ades
it
might
happen
to
khiv
five
if
we
can
find
out
what
it
was
we
ll
take
steps
so
it
won
t
happen
again
just
leave
us
alone
said
the
untidy
woman
fiercely
we
can
get
along
without
men
or
ades
or
anything
else
go
away
dangerous
trip
dona
plucked
at
kim
s
arm
he
turned
seething
and
went
out
outside
he
vented
his
bitterness
i
thought
men
were
crazy
he
said
if
she
s
the
head
of
the
planet
government
i
pity
the
planet
she
could
talk
to
another
woman
quite
rationally
dona
said
with
satisfaction
but
she
s
had
to
persuade
herself
that
she
hates
men
and
you
had
me
with
you
and
i
m
prettier
than
she
is
kim
and
i
have
you
so
she
couldn
t
talk
to
you
but
she
s
unreasonable
kim
said
stubbornly
we
ll
go
back
to
the
ship
said
dona
brightly
i
ll
lock
you
in
it
and
then
go
find
out
what
we
want
to
know
she
smiled
comfortably
all
the
way
back
to
the
starshine
but
the
staring
women
made
kim
acutely
uncomfortable
when
he
was
safely
inside
the
ship
he
wiped
perspiration
from
his
forehead
i
wouldn
t
want
to
live
on
this
planet
he
said
feverishly
i
wouldn
t
want
you
to
said
dona
stay
inside
darling
you
d
better
not
even
show
yourself
at
a
vision
port
heaven
forbid
said
kim
dona
went
out
kim
paced
up
and
down
the
living
quarters
of
the
ship
there
was
something
in
the
back
of
his
mind
that
would
not
quite
come
out
the
disappearance
of
ades
was
impossible
men
had
conquered
one
galaxy
and
now
started
on
a
second
but
never
yet
had
they
destroyed
a
planet
never
yet
had
they
even
moved
one
but
nevertheless
only
thirty
six
hours
ago
the
planet
ades
had
revolved
about
its
sun
and
men
and
women
had
strolled
into
its
matter
transmitter
with
no
hint
of
danger
and
between
two
seconds
something
had
happened
even
had
the
planet
been
shattered
into
dust
its
remnants
should
have
been
discoverable
and
surely
a
device
which
could
destroy
a
planet
would
have
had
some
preliminary
testings
and
the
galaxy
would
have
heard
of
its
existence
this
thing
that
had
happened
was
inconceivable
on
the
basis
of
the
photographs
ades
had
not
only
been
destroyed
but
the
quintillions
of
tons
of
its
substance
had
been
removed
so
far
that
sunlight
shining
upon
them
did
not
light
them
enough
for
photography
which
simply
could
not
be
kim
wrestled
with
the
problem
while
dona
went
about
in
the
world
of
women
there
was
something
odd
about
her
in
the
eyes
of
women
of
khiv
five
their
faces
were
unlike
the
faces
of
the
women
of
a
normal
world
on
a
world
with
men
and
women
all
women
wear
masks
their
thoughts
are
unreadable
but
where
there
are
no
men
masks
are
useless
the
women
of
khiv
five
saw
plainly
that
dona
was
unlike
them
but
they
were
willing
to
talk
to
her
she
came
back
to
the
starshine
as
kim
reached
a
state
of
complete
bewilderment
ades
could
not
have
been
destroyed
but
it
had
vanished
even
if
shattered
its
fragments
could
not
have
been
moved
so
far
or
so
fast
that
they
could
no
longer
be
detected
but
they
were
undiscoverable
the
thing
was
impossible
on
any
scale
of
power
conceivable
for
humans
to
use
but
it
had
happened
so
kim
paced
back
and
forth
and
bit
his
nails
until
dona
returned
we
can
take
off
kim
she
said
quietly
she
locked
the
inner
airlock
door
as
if
shutting
out
something
she
twisted
the
fastening
extra
tight
her
face
was
pale
what
about
ades
asked
kim
they
had
matter
transmission
to
it
from
here
too
said
dona
you
remember
the
original
transmitter
on
ades
was
one
way
only
it
would
receive
but
not
send
some
new
ones

built
after
the
war
with
sinab
though
and
this
planet
s
communication
with
ades
cut
off
just
when
ours
did
thirty
six
hours
ago
none
of
the
other
twenty
planets
had
communication
with
it
either
something
happened
and
on
the
instant
everything
stopped
what
caused
it
kim
asked
but
dona
paid
no
attention
take
off
kim
she
said
men
are
marching
out
of
the
matter
transmitter
marching
i
said
kim
armed
men
marching
as
soldiers
with
machine
mounted
heavy
weapons
somebody
knows
ades
can
t
protect
its
own
any
more
and
invaders
must
be
crowding
in
for
the
spoils
i
m
afraid
kim
that
ades
has
been
destroyed
and
our
planets
are
part
of
a
tyrant
s
empire
now
later
the
starshine
swooped
down
from
the
blue
toward
the
matter
transmitter
on
khiv
five
serried
ranks
of
marching
figures
were
tramping
out
of
the
transmitter
s
silvery
wavering
film
in
strict
geometric
rows
they
marched
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
they
were
a
glittering
stream
moving
rhythmically
in
unison
proceeding
to
join
an
already
arrived
mass
of
armed
men
already
drawn
up
in
impressive
array
racing
toward
the
high
arch
of
the
transmitter
with
air
screaming
about
the
starshine
s
hull
kim
saw
grimly
that
the
figures
were
soldiers
as
dona
had
said
he
had
never
before
seen
a
soldier
in
actual
life
but
pictures
and
histories
had
made
them
familiar
enough
these
were
figures
out
of
the
unthinkably
remote
past
they
wore
helmets
of
polished
metal
they
glittered
with
shining
orichalc
and
chromium
the
bright
small
flashes
of
faceted
corundum
synthetic
sapphire
in
all
the
shades
from
blue
white
to
ruby
shone
from
their
identical
costumes
and
equipment
they
were
barbarous
in
their
splendor
and
strange
in
the
precision
and
unison
of
their
movements
which
was
like
nothing
so
much
as
the
antics
of
girl
precision
dancers
without
the
extravagance
of
the
dancers
gestures
the
starshine
dipped
lower
it
shot
along
a
canyon
like
open
way
between
buildings
the
matter
transmitter
was
upon
a
hill
within
the
city
and
the
ship
was
now
lower
than
the
transmitter
and
the
heads
of
the
soldiers
who
still
tramped
out
of
the
archway
in
a
scintillating
stream
kim
raged
soldiers
were
an
absurdity
on
top
of
a
catastrophe
something
had
erased
the
planet
ades
from
its
orbit
around
a
lonely
sun
that
bespoke
science
and
intelligence
beyond
anything
dreamed
of
hitherto
but
soldiers
marching
like
dancing
girls
bedecked
with
jewels
and
polished
metal
like
the
women
of
the
pleasure
world
of
dite
this
military
display
was
pure
childishness
our
pressure
wave
ll
topple
them
said
kim
savagely
at
least
we
ll
smash
the
transmitter
there
was
a
monstrous
roaring
noise
the
starshine
which
had
flashed
through
intergalactic
space
at
speeds
no
science
was
yet
able
to
measure
roared
between
tall
buildings
in
atmosphere
wind
whirled
and
howled
past
its
hull
it
dived
forward
toward
the
soldiers
there
was
one
instant
when
the
ship
was
barely
yards
above
the
gaping
faces
of
startled
barbarously
accoutred
troopers
the
following
spreading
pressure
wave
of
the
ship
s
faster
than
sound
movement
spread
out
on
every
side
like
a
three
dimensional
wake
it
toppled
the
soldiers
as
it
hit
they
went
down
in
unison
in
a
wildly
waving
light
flashing
tangle
of
waving
arms
and
legs
and
savage
weapons
but
kim
saw
too
squat
and
bell
mouthed
instruments
on
wheels
in
the
act
of
swinging
to
bear
upon
him
one
bore
on
the
starshine
it
was
impossible
to
stop
or
swerve
the
ship
there
was
yet
another
fraction
of
a
second
of
kaleidoscopic
confusion
of
momentary
glimpses
of
incredibly
antique
and
childish
pomp
and
then
anguish
struck
it
was
the
hellish
torment
of
a
fighting
beam
more
concentrated
and
more
horrible
than
any
other
agony
known
to
mankind
for
the
infinitesimal
fraction
of
an
instant
kim
experienced
it
to
the
full
then
there
was
nothingness
there
was
no
sound
there
was
no
planet
there
was
no
sunlight
on
tall
and
stately
structures
built
by
men
long
murdered
from
the
skies
the
vision
ports
showed
remote
and
peaceful
suns
and
all
the
tranquil
glory
of
interstellar
space
the
starshine
floated
in
emptiness
it
was
of
course
the
result
of
that
very
small
device
that
kim
had
built
into
the
starshine
before
even
the
invention
of
the
transmitter
drive
it
was
a
relay
which
flung
on
faster
than
light
drive
the
instant
fighting
beams
struck
any
living
body
in
the
ship
the
starshine
had
been
thrown
into
full
interstellar
drive
while
still
in
atmosphere
it
had
plunged
upward
along
the
line
of
its
aiming
through
the
air
the
result
of
its
passage
to
khiv
five
could
only
be
guessed
at
but
in
even
the
unthinkably
minute
part
of
a
second
it
remained
in
air
the
ship
s
outside
temperatures
had
risen
two
hundred
degrees
moving
at
multiples
of
the
speed
of
light
it
must
have
created
an
instantaneous
flash
of
literally
stellar
heat
by
the
mere
compression
of
air
before
it
kim
was
sick
and
shaken
by
the
agony
which
would
have
killed
him
had
it
lasted
as
long
as
the
hundredth
of
a
second
but
dona
stared
at
him
kim
what
oh
she
ran
to
him
the
beam
had
not
touched
her
so
close
to
the
projector
it
had
been
narrow
no
more
than
a
yard
across
it
had
struck
kim
and
missed
dona
oh
my
poor
kim
he
grimaced
forget
it
he
said
breathing
hard
we
ve
both
had
it
before
but
not
as
bad
as
this
it
was
a
mobile
fighting
beam
projector
i
imagine
they
ll
think
we
burned
up
in
a
flash
of
lightning
i
hope
there
were
x
rays
for
them
to
enjoy
for
a
long
time
kim
rendell
sat
still
with
his
eyes
closed
the
dosage
of
the
fighting
beam
had
been
greater
than
they
had
ever
experienced
together
though
it
left
him
weak
and
sick
funny
he
said
presently
barbarous
enough
to
have
soldiers
with
decorative
uniforms
and
shiny
dingle
dangles
on
them
and
modern
enough
to
have
fighting
beam
projectors
and
a
weapon
that
s
wiped
ades
out
of
space
we
ve
got
to
find
out
who
they
are
dona
and
where
they
came
from
they
ve
something
quite
new
i
wonder
said
dona
but
she
still
looked
at
kim
with
troubled
eyes
eh
if
it
s
new
said
dona
if
it
s
a
weapon
even
if
if
ades
is
destroyed
kim
stared
at
her
now
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
don
t
quite
know
admitted
dona
i
say
things
and
you
turn
them
over
in
your
head
and
something
quite
new
comes
out
i
told
you
a
story
about
a
dust
grain
once
and
you
made
the
transmitter
drive
that
took
us
to
ades
in
the
first
place
and
made
everything
else

afterward
hmmm
said
kim
meditatively
if
it
s
new
if
it
s
a
weapon
if
ades
is
destroyed
why
did
you
think
of
those
three
things
you
said
no
planet
had
ever
been
destroyed
she
told
him
if
anybody
could
think
of
a
way
to
do
such
a
thing
you
could
and
when
sinab
had
to
be
fought
and
there
weren
t
any
weapons
you
worked
out
a
way
to
conquer
them
with
things
that
certainly
weren
t
weapons
just
broadcasters
of
the
disciplinary
circuit
field
so
i
wondered
if
what
they
used
was
a
weapon
of
course
if
it
wasn
t
a
weapon
it
was
probably
something
that
had
been
used
before
for
some
other
purpose
and
it
wouldn
t
be
new
i
ve
got
to
think
about
that
said
kim
he
cogitated
for
a
moment
yes
i
definitely
have
to
think
about
that
then
he
stood
up
we
ll
try
to
identify
these
gentry
first
then
we
ll
go
to
another
of
the
twenty
one
planets

over
he
took
his
observations
and
swung
the
little

about

adjusted
the
radiation
switch
to
throw
off
the

to

for
the

its
fourth
planet

been
subjugated
to
the
empire
of
sinab
ten
years
before
and
freed
by
the
men
of

six
years
since
the

winked
into
being
some
twenty
million
miles
from
it
and
two
hundred
million
from
the
star
kim
looked
annoyed
and
then
glanced
at
the
relay
and
adjusted
it
again
he
pointed
the
starshine
close
to
the
planet

disk
he
pressed
the
transmitter
drive
button
instantly
the

was
within

thousands

kim
worked
on
after
a
long
time
a
speaker
suddenly
emitted
a
blast
of
martial
music
until
now
the
broadcast
programs
had
gone
unheeded
by
both
kim
and
dona
because
from
each
wave

only
women
s
voices
had
come
out
and
only
women
s
music
the
sound
of
brazen
horns
was
something
new
dona
smiled
at

and
turned
up
the

a

pompously
to

of

in

therefore
his

elim
the

has
commanded
his
loyal

troops
to
occupy
the
said
planet
thom

to
defend
it
against

whatsoever

to

to
its

all
the
benefits
of

given
at

the

stopped
there
was
another
blare
of
martial
music
the
broadcast
ended
ten
minutes
later
on
another
wave
length
the
same
proclamation
was
repeated
that
broadcast
stopped
too
five
minutes
later
came
still
another
broadcast
and
so
on
and
so
on
at
long
last
there
was
but
a
single
wave
length
coming
into
the
communicators
it
was
a
broadcast
of
a
drama
with
only
female
characters
and
in
which
there
was
no
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
human
race
normally
includes
two
sexes
it
was
highly
emotional
and
it
was
very
strange
indeed
then
a
pompous
male
voice
read
the
silly
proclamation
and
the
broadcast
cut
off
the
question
said
kim
is
whether
i
d
better
try
to
catch
a
soldier
and
make
him
tell
us
where
gornith
is
and
what
planet
is
ruled
by

the
fortieth

dona
i

you
but
i
certainly

let
you
venture
out
on
a

full
of
women
and
there
s
something
else
what
there

twenty

planets

to
protect
what
planetary

send

to

one
other

do
you

this
king
elim
the
fortieth
has
tried
to
seize
all
of
them
or
do
you
think
he
arranged
a
co
perative
steal
with
the
rulers
of
other
planets
and
an
arrangement
for
them

very
carefully
an
electronic
circuit
now
he
began
to
simplify
it
he
frowned
from
time
to
time
however
and
by
his
expression
was
thinking
of
something
else
than
the
meticulous
placing
of
symbols
on
paper
it
was
symptomatic
of
his
confidence
in
dona
though
that
he
remained
absorbed
while
she
worked
the
ship
presently
there
were
mutterings
in

said
suddenly
from
a

a
heavy
male
voice

by

on

there
was
confusion
on

the

sternly
told
by
one
set
of
voices
that
it
now
owed
allegiance
to
queen
amritha
of

and
by
another
set
that

shortly
throw
out
the
megarian
invaders

forever

vultures
pounced
on
the

if

sixteen

not
a

a

murdered
so
a

princelings

feast
on
the

nasty
little

impatient
toss
of

she
protested
maybe

solution
for

let

as
something
to
fight
for
go
by
the
board

be
strictly
practical
you

on

impatiently

in
vexation
there

some
way
out
of

just
contrived
a
way
to
make
a
very
desirable
change
in
all
the
governments
of
the
first
galaxy
given
time
it
was
one
of
those
problems
that
seem
too
big
to
handle
but
it
worked
out
very
easily
but
i
absolutely
can
t
think
of
the
ghost
of
an
idea
of
how
to
find
a
friendly
world
for

no

continuous
the
industrial
area
covered
a
continent
of
sprawling
rectangular
buildings
designed
for
the
ultimate
of

kim
newly
shaved
and
rested
forgot
to
yawn
as
he
stared
through
the
vision
ports
at
the
endless
vista
of
structures
made
with
a
deliberate
lack
of
grace
from
a
hundred
mile
height
they
could
be
seen
everywhere
to
north
and
south
to
the
eastward
where
it
was
already
close
to
midday
and
to
where
shadows
beyond
the
dawn
hid
them
even
from
that
altitude
they
were
no
mere
specks
between
the

they
were
definite
shapes
each

the

down
and
down
and
down
kim
felt
uncomfortable
and
realized
why
he
spoke
drily
i
don
t
suppose
we
ll
ever
land
on
any
new
planet
without
being
ready
to
wince
from
a
fighting
beam
and
find
ourselves
snatched
to
hell
and
gone
away
dona
did
not
answer
she
gazed
at
the
industrial
plants
as
they
swelled
in
size
with
the
starshine
s
descent
buildings
two
miles
to
a
side
were
commonplace
great
rectangles
three
and
even
four
miles
long
showed
here
and
there
and
there
were
at
least
half
a
dozen
buildings
plainly
factory
units
which
were
more
than
ten
miles
in
extent
on
each
of
their
ground
dimensions
when
the
starshine
was
below
the
clouds
dona
focused
the
electron
telescope
on
one
of
them
and
gestured
to
call
kim
s
attention
to
the
sight
this
factory
building
enclosed
great
quadrangles
with
gigantic
courtyards
to
allow
perhaps
of
light
and
within
the
courtyards
were
dwelling
units
for
workmen
the
telescope
showed
them
plainly
workmen
in
factories
like
this
would
have
no
need
and
little
opportunity
ever
to
go
beyond
the
limits
of
their
place
of
employment
the
factory
in
which
they
labored
would
confront
them
on
every
hand
at
every
instant
of
their
life
from
birth
until
death
that
s
something
i
don
t
like
without
even
asking
questions
about
it
said
kim
he
took
the
controls
the
starshine

he
remembered
to
flick
on
the
communicators
a
droning
filled
the
interior
of
the
space
ship
dona
looked
puzzled
and
tuned
in
a
male
voice
mumbled
swiftly
and
without
intonation
through
a
long
series
of
numerals
and
initial
letters
it

she
turned
up
another
wave

a
voice
barked
hysterically
the
words
ran
so
swiftly
together
that
they
were
almost
indistinguishable
but
certain
syllables
came
out
in
patterns

none

all

without

with
a
nerve
racking
haste
the

before
a
gigantic

an

at

trudged
across
to

he

he

stupid
he
said
shortly
he
knows
what
to
guard
and
the
name
of
the

a

the

and

she
was
designed
for
movement
in
space
with
parsecs
of
distance
on
every
hand
she
was
unhandy
when
used
as
now
for
an
atmosphere
flier
she
descended
within
a
factory
quadrangle
there
was
no
one
about
literally
no
one
the
dwelling
units
were
occupied
to
be
sure
but
no
one
moved
anywhere
when
kim
opened
the
airlock
there
was
a
dull
grumbling
rumble
in
the
air
it
came
from
the
many
storied
building
which
surrounded
this
courtyard
and
stretched
away
for
miles
kim
and
dona
stood
blankly
in
the
airlock
door
the
air
had
no
odor
at
all
there
was
no
dust
there
was
not
a
single
particle
of
growing
stuff
anywhere
to
people
who
had
lived
on
terranova
it
was
incredible
then
bells
rang
hundreds
and
thousands
of
bells
they
rang
stridently
in
all
the
rooms
and
corridors
of
all
the
dwelling
units
which
reached
away
as
far
as
the
eye
could
follow
them
it
was
a
ghastly
sound
because
every
bell
was
in
exactly
the
same
tone
and
made
exactly
the
same
tintinabulation
then
there
was
a
stirring
in
the
houses
folk
moved
within
them
figures
passed
inside
the
windows
now
and
again
briefly
faces
peered
out
but
none
lingered
to
stare
at
what
must
have
been
the
unprecedented
sight
of
a
space
ship
resting
in
the
courtyard
after
a
little
figures
appeared
in
the
doors
men
and
women
swarmed
out
and
streamed
toward
openings
in
the
factory
building
their
heads
turned
to
gaze
at
the
ship
but
they
did
not
even
slacken
speed
in
their
haste
toward
the
sound
of
industry
kim
hailed
them
they
looked
at
him
blankly
and
hurried
on
he
caught
hold
of
a
man
where
will
i
find
the
leader
he
asked
sharply
the
boss
the
government
the
king
or
whatever
you
have
where
the
man
struggled
i
be

he
protested
unhappily
i
work
i
be
late
where
s
the
government
kim
repeated
more
sharply
still
the
king
or

or
whoever
makes
the
laws
or
whatever
the
devil
i
be

panted
the
man
he
twisted
out
of
kim
s
grasp
and
ran
to
join
the
swarming
folk
now
approaching
the
great
building
they
hurried
inside
the
quadrangle
was
again
empty
kim
scowled
then
other
workers
came
out
of
the
factory
and
plodded
wearily
toward
the
dwelling
units
kim
waylaid
a
man
and
shot
questions
at
him
his
speech
was
slurred
with
fatigue
dona
could
not
understand
him
at
all
but
he
gazed
at
the
starshine
and
groped
heavily
for
answers
to
kim
s
questions
and
at
the
end
trudged
exhaustedly
into
a
doorway
kim
came
into
the
ship
scowling
he
seated
himself
at
the
control
board
the
ship
lifted
once
more
he
headed
toward
the
curve
of
the
plant

bulging
form
what
did
you
learn
kim
this
is
the
work
continent
said
kim
shortly
the
factories
and
the
workmen
are
here
the
owners
live
in
a
place
of
their
own
i
have
to
talk
to
one
of
the
more
important
merchants
i
need
information
time
passed
and
the
ship
went
on
over
the
rim
of
the
planet
orbital
speed
was
impossible
the
starshine
stayed
almost
within
atmosphere
and
moved
eastward
at
no
more
than
fifteen
hundred
miles
an
hour
here
it
is
said
kim
at
last
the
ship
settled
down
once
more
there
was
a
thin
hazy
overcast
here
and
clear
vision
came
suddenly
as
they
dropped
below
it
and
the
coast
and
the
land
before
them
brought
an
exclamation
from
dona
the
shoreline
was
magnificent
all
beautiful
bold
cliffs
with
rolling
hills
behind
them
there
were
mountains
on
farther
yet
and
splendid
vistas
everywhere
but
more
than
the
land
or
the
natural
setting
it
was
what
men
had
done
which
caused
dona
to
exclaim
the
whole
terrain
was
landscaped
like
a
garden
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
the
starshine
still
flew
high
every
hillside
and
every
plain
had
been
made
into
artificial
but
marvelous
gardens
there
were
houses
here
and
there
some
were
huge
and
gracefully
spreading
or
airily
soaring
upward
or
simple
with
the
simplicity
of
gems
and
yet
magnificent
beyond
compare
there
was
ostentation
here
to
be
sure
but
there
was
surely
no
tawdriness
there
was
no
city
in
sight
there
was
not
even
a
grouping
of
houses
yet
many
of
the
houses
were
large
enough
to
shelter
communities
i
see
said
kim
the
workmen
live
near
the
factories
or
in
their
compounds
the
owners
have
their
homes
safely
away
from
the
ugly
part
of
commerce
they
ve
a
small
sized
continent
of
country
homes
dona
and
undoubtedly
it
is
very
pleasant
to
live
here
whom
shall
we
deal
with
dona
shook
her
head
kim
picked
a
magnificent
residence
at
random
he
slanted
the
starshine
down
presently
it
landed
lightly
upon
smooth
lawn
of
incredible
perfection
before
a
home
that
dona
regarded
with
shining
eyes
it
s
lovely
she
said
breathlessly
it
is
agreed
kim
it
even
has
a
feeling
all
its
own
he
said
the
palace
of
a
king
or
a
tyrant
always
has
something
of
arrogance
about
it
it
s
designed
to
impress
the
onlooker
a
pleasure
palace
is
always
tawdry
it
s
designed
to
flatter
the
man
who
enters
it
these
houses
are
solid
they
re
the
homes
of
men
who
are
thinking
of
generations
to
follow
them
and
meanwhile
only
of
themselves
i
ve
heard
of
the
merchant
princes
of

five
and
i
m
prejudiced
i
don
t
like
those
factories
with
the
workmen
s
homes
inside
but
i
like
this
house
do
you
want
to
come
with
me
dona
looked
at
the
house
yearningly
at
the
view
all
about
every
tree
and
every
stone
so
placed
as
to
constitute
perfection
the
effect
was
not
that
of
a
finicky
estheticism
but
of
authentic
beauty
and
dignity
but
after
a
moment
dona
shook
her
head
i
don
t
think
i
d
better
she
said
slowly
i
m
a
woman
and
i
d
want
one
like
it
i
ll
stay
in
the

at
the
view
you
ve
a
communicator
kim
nodded
he
opened
the
airlock
door
and
stepped
out
he
walked
toward
the
great
building
dona
watched
his
figure
grow
small
in
its
progress
toward
the
mansion
she
watched
him
approach
the
ceremonial
entrance
she
saw
a
figure
in
formalized
rich
clothing
appear
in
that
doorway
and
bow
to
him
kim
spoke
with
gestures
the
richly
clothed
servant
bowed
for
him
to
go
first
into
the
house
kim
entered
and
the
door
closed
dona
looked
at
her
surroundings
dignity
and
tranquility
and
beauty
were
here
children
growing
up
in
such
an
environment
would
be
very
happy
and
would
feel
utterly
safe
wide
smooth
close
cropped
lawns
with
ancient
trees
and
flowering
shrubs
stretched
away
to
the
horizons
there
was
the
gleam
of
statuary
here
and
there
rarely
a
long
way
off
she
could
see
the
glitter
of
water
and
beside
it
a
graceful
colonnade
and
she
knew
that
it
was
a
pleasure
pool
once
she
saw
two
boys
staring
at
the
space
ship
there
was
no
trace
of
fear
in
their
manner
but
a
richly
dressed
servant
much
more
carefully
garbed
than
the
boys
led
up
two
of
the
slim
riding
sards
of
phanis
and
the
boys
mounted
and
their
steeds
started
off
with
that
sinuous
smooth
swiftness
which
only
sards
possess
in
all
the
first
galaxy
time
passed
and
shadows
lengthened
finally
dona
realized
how
many
hours
had
elapsed
since
kim
s
departure
she
was
beginning
to
grow
uneasy
when
the
door
opened
again
and
kim
came
out
followed
by
four
richly
clad
servants
those
servants
carried
bundles
kim
s
voice
came
over
the
communicator
close
the
inner
airlock
door
dona
and
don
t
open
it
until
i
say
so
dona
obeyed
she
watched
uneasily
the
four
servants
placed
their
parcels
inside
the
airlock
at
a
gesture
from
kim
then
there
was
an
instant
of
odd
tension
dona
could
not
see
the
servants
but
she
saw
kim
smiling
mirthlessly
at
them
he
made
no
move
to
enter
he
spoke
sharply
and
she
heard
them
file
out
of
the
airlock
dona
could
see
them
again
kim
stepped
into
the
space
ship
and
closed
the
door
take
her
up
dona
fast
the
starshine
shot
upward
with
the
four
servants
craning
their
necks
to
look
at
it
it
was
out
of
sight
of
the
ground
in
seconds
it
was
out
of
the
atmosphere
before
kim
came
into
the
control
room
from
the
lock
quite
a
civilization
he
said
you
d
have
liked
that
house
dona
there
s
a
staff
of
several
hundred
servants
and
it
is
beautiful
inside
the
man
who
owns
it
is
also
master
of
one
of
the
bigger
industrial
plants
he
doesn
t
go
to
the
plant
of
course

his
offices
at

with
a
corps
of
secretaries

a
television
screen
for
interviews
with
his
underlings
quite
a
chap
were
those
four
men

no
they
were

kim
drily
there
are
no
proletarians
around
that
place
and
none
are
permitted
guards
stand
watch
night
and
day
i
d
told
my
friend
that
the
starshine
was
packed
with
lethal
gadgets
with
which
ades
had
won
at
least
one
war
and
he
s
in
the
munitions
business
so
i
wasn
t
going
to
let
his
guards
get
inside
they
wanted
to
badly
insisting
they
had
to
put
their
parcels
in
the
proper
place
he
d
have
paid
them
lavishly
if
they
could
have
captured
a
ship
like
the
starshine
he
laughed
a
little
i
was
lucky
to
pick
a
munitions
maker
there
aren
t
many
wars
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
but
he
turns
out
weapons
for
palace
guards
mobile
fighting
beam
projectors
and
so
on
all
the
equipment
for
a
planet
ruler
who
wants
a
fancy
army
for
parades
or
a
force
with
a
punch
to
fight
off
any
sneak
attack
via
matter
transmitter
that
s
what
your
average
ruler
is
afraid
of
and
what
he
keeps
an
army
to
defend
himself
against
of
course
the
disciplinary
circuit
takes
care
of
his
subjects
vanished
world
ahead
of
them
loomed
the
sun
spicus
many
millions
of
miles
away
while
beneath
them
lay
the
planet
spicus
five
a
vast
hemisphere
which
was
rapidly
shrinking
into
the
distance
kim
moved
over
beside
dona
and
stared
reflectively
at
the
instrument
board
i
got
frightened
kim
the
girl
said
you
were
gone
so
long
i
was
bargaining
kim
answered
i
told
him
i
came
from
ades
i
d
a
space
ship
so
he
could
believe
that
then
i
told
him
what
had
happened
selling
munitions
he
should
have
known
about
it
beforehand
and
i
think
he
did
he
doubted
that
i
d
come
from
ades
as
quickly
as
i
said
though
until
i
recited
the
names
of
some
of
the
gracious
majesties
who
are
making
a
grab
of
planets
then
he
was
sure
so
he
wanted
to
strike
a
bargain
with
me
for
terranova
he
d
supply
it
with
arms
he
said
in
exchange
for
a
star
cluster
of
his
own
in
the
second
galaxy
if
i
d
set
up
a
private
matter
transmitter
for
him
kim
laughed
without
mirth
he
could
colonize
a
couple
of
planets
himself
and
make
a
syndicate
to
handle
the
rest
he
saw
himself
changing
his
status
from
that
of
a
merchant
princeling
to
that
of
a
landed
proprietor
with
half
a
dozen
planets
as
private
estates
and
probably
a
crown
to
wear
on
week
ends
and
when
he
retired
from
business
on
spicus
five
there
are
precedents
i
gather
but
kim
protested
dona
what
did
you
do
i
did
one
thing
that
s
been
needed
for
a
long
time
said
kim
grimly
it
seems
to
me
that
i
do
everything
backwards
i
should
have
attended
to
the
matter
of
ades
first
but
i
had
a
chance
and
took
it
i
think
i
put
something
in
motion
that
will
ultimately
smash
up
the
whole
cursed
system
that
s
made
slaves
of
every
human
being
but
those
on
ades
and
terranova
the
disciplinary
circuit
back
on
ades
we
ve
talked
about
the
need
to
free
the
people
of
this
galaxy
it
s
always
seemed
too
big
a
job
but
i
think
it
s
started
now
it
will
be
a
profitable
business
and
my
friend
who
wanted
to
bargain
for
some
planets
in
the
second
galaxy
will
make
a
pretty
penny
of
the
beginning
and
it
will
carry
on
of
itself
the
planet
below
and
behind
was
now
only
a
globe
it
soon
dwindled
into
a
tiny
ball
kim
touched

on
the

up

stamped

kim
you

misunderstanding
me
on

what
about
ades
did
you
find
out
what
happened
to
it
kim
began
the
process
of
sighting
the
starshine
s
nose
upon
a
single
distant
minute
speck
of
light
which
seemingly
could
not
be
told
from
a
million
other
points
of
light
all
of
which
were
suns
i
think
i
found
out
something
he
told
her
i
thought
a
merchant
planet
would
be
the
place
to
hear
all
the
gossip
of
the
galaxy
my
friend
back
yonder
put
his
research
organization
to
work
finding
out
what
i
wanted
to
know
what
they
dug
up
looks
plausible
right
now
i
m
going
to
get
even
for
it
that
s
a
necessity
after
that
we
ll
see
there
were
sixteen
million
people
on
ades
we
ll
try
to
do
something
about
them
they
aren
t
likely
to
be
all
dead
yet
the
sun
of
ades
swam
in
emptiness
for
uncountable
billions
of
years
it
had
floated
serenely
with
its
single
planet
circling
it
in
the
companionability
of
bodies
separated
only
by
millions
of
miles
when
their
next
nearest
neighbors
are
light
years
away
a
sun
with
one
planet
is
a
great
rarity
a
sun
with
no
satellites
save
for
giant
pulsing
cepheids
and
close
coupled
double
suns
is
almost
unknown
but
for
billions
upon
billions
of
years
that
sun
and
ades
had
kept
each
other
company
then
men
had
appeared
for
a
thousand
years
great
space
ships
had
grimly
trundled
back
and
forth
to
unload
their
cargoes
of
criminals
upon
the
chilly
small
world
ades
was
chosen
as
a
prison
planet
from
the
beginning
later
matter
transmitters
made
the
journeys
of
space
craft
useless
for
six
seven
eight
thousand
years
there
was
no
traffic
but
the
one
way
traffic
of
its
especially
contrived
transmitter
which
would
receive
criminals
from
all
the
galaxy
but
would
return
none
or
any
news
of
them
to
the
worlds
outside
during
all
that
time
a
lonely
guard
ship
hung
drearily
about
watching
lest
someone
try
to
rescue
a
man
doomed
to
hopeless
exile
and
return
him
to
happier
scenes
and
finally
the
guard
ship
had
gone
away
because
the
space
ways
were
no
longer
used
by
anybody
and
there
were
no
ships
in
the
void
save
those
of
the
patrol
itself
accordingly
the
patrol
was
disbanded
for
hundreds
of
years
nothing
happened
at
all
and
then
kim
rendell
came
in
the
starshine
and
shortly
thereafter
tiny
ships
began
to
take
off
from
ades
and
they
fought
valorously
on
distant
star
systems
and
at
last
a
squadron
of
war
craft
came
to
subjugate
ades
for
the
beastly
empire
of
sinab
finally
there
was
a
battle
in
the
bright
beams
of
the
lonely
sun
itself
and
after
that
for
a
time
little
space
ships
swam
up
from
the
planet
and
darted
away
and
darted
back
and
darted
away
and
back
but
never
before
had
there
been
any
such
situation
as
now
the
sun
which
had
kept
company
with
ades
for
so
long
now
shone
in
lonely
splendor
amid
emptiness
devoid
of
its
companion
and
that
emptiness
was
bewildering
to
a
small
ship
sister
to
the
starshine
which
flicked
suddenly
into
being
nearby
the
ship
had
come
back
from
a
journey
among
the
virgin
stars
of
the
second
galaxy
with
honorable
scars
upon
its
hull
and
a
zestful
young
crew
who
wished
to
boast
of
their
journeying
they
had
come
back
to
ades
so
they
thought
direct
not
even
stopping
at
terranova
and
there
was
no
ades
the
little
ship
flashed
here
and
there
about
the
bereft
sun
in
bewilderment
it
searched
desperately
for
a
planet
some
seven
thousand
miles
in
diameter
which
had
apparently
been
misplaced
and
as
it
hunted
a
second
ship
whisked
into
sight
from
faster
than
light
drive
the
detectors
of
the
two
ships
told
them
of
each
other
s
presence
and
they
met
and
hung
in
space
together
then
they
searched
in
unison
but
in
vain
at
long
last
they
set
out
in
company
for
one
of
the
planets
of
the
former
sinabian
empire
on
which
there
must
be
some
news
of
what
had
happened
to
ades
on
transmitter
drive
they
inevitably
separated
and
one
was
much
closer
to
the
chosen
planet
when
they
came
out
of
stressed
space
one
drove
down
into
atmosphere
while
the
other
was
still
thousands
of
miles
away
the
leading
ship
went
down
at
landing
speed
toward
a
city
the
other
ship
watched
by
electron
telescope
and
prepared
to
duplicate
its
course
but
the
man
of
the
second
ship
saw
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
that
suddenly
the
landing
ship
vanished
from
its
place
as
if
it
had
gone
into
intergalactic
drive
in
atmosphere
there
was
a
flash
of
intolerable
unbearable
light
and
then
there
was
an
explosion
of
such
monstrous
violence
that
half
of
the
planet
s
capital
city
vanished
or
was
laid
in
ruins
the
crew
of
the
second
ship
were
stunned
but
the
second
ship
went
slowly
and
cautiously
down
into
atmosphere
and
its
communicators
picked
up
voices
issuing
stern
warnings
that
troops
must
be
welcomed
by
all
citizens
and
that
absolute
obedience
must
be
given
to
all
men
wearing
the
uniform
of
his
magnificence
the
despot
of
lith
and
then
there
was
babbling
confusion
and
contradictory
shoutings
and
a
hoarse
voice
ordered
all
soldiers
of
his
magnificence
to
keep
a
ceaseless
watch
upon
the
sky
because
a
ship
had
come
down
from
overhead
and
when
the
fighting
beams
struck
it
to
kill
its
crew
it
appeared
to
have
fired
some
devastating
projectile
which
had
destroyed
half
a
great
city
all
ships
seen
in
the
sky
were
to
be
shot
down
instantly
his
magnificence
the
despot
of
lith
would
avenge
the
outrage
the
lonely
surviving
ship
went
dazedly
away
from
the
planet
which
once
had
been
friendly
to
the
men
of
ades
it
went
back
to
ades
sun
and
searched
despairingly
once
again
and
then
fled
to
the
second
galaxy
and
terranova
to
tell
of
what
it
had
seen
that
was
an
event
of
some
importance
at
least
all
of
one
planet
had
been
rocked
to
its
core
from
the
detonation
of
a
space
ship
which
flashed
into
collision
with
it
at
uncountable
multiples
of
the
speed
of
light
and
was
thereby
raised
to
the
temperature
of
a
hot
sun
s
very
heart
and
besides
there
was
agitation
and
suspicion
and
threats
and
diplomatic
chaos
among
the
planetary
governments
who
had
joined
to
loot
the
dependencies
of
ades
once
ades
was
eliminated
from
the
scene
but
a
vastly
an
enormously
more
significant
event
took
place
on
a
planet
very
far
away
at
almost
the
same
instant
the
planet
was
donet
three
the
only
habitable
planet
of
its
system
it
was
a
monstrous
sprawling
world
visibly
flattened
by
the
speed
of
its
rotation
and
actually
habitable
only
by
the
fact
that
its
rotation
partly
balanced
out
its
high
gravity
the
starshine
approached
over
a
polar
region
and
descended
to
touch
atmosphere
then
while
dona
looked
curiously
through
the
electron
telescope
at
monstrous
ice
mountains
below
kim
donned
a
space
suit
went
into
the
airlock
and
dropped
a
small
object
out
of
the
door
he
closed
the
door
returned
to
the
control
room
and
took
the
starshine
out
to
space
again
that
was
the
most
significant
single
action
in
view
of
its
ultimate
meaning
that
had
been
performed
in
the
first
galaxy
in
ten
thousand
years
and
yet
in
a
sense
it
was
purely
a
matter
of
form
it
was
not
necessary
for
kim
to
do
it
he
had
arranged
for
the
same
effect
to
be
produced
in
time
yet
to
come
upon
every
one
of
the
three
hundred
million
inhabited
planets
of
the
first
galaxy
the
thing
was
automatic
implicit
in
the
very
nature
of
the
tyrannical
governments
sustained
by
the
disciplinary
circuit
kim
had
simply
dropped
a
small
metal
case
to
the
surface
of
donet
three
it
was
very
strong
practically
unbreakable
it
contained
an
extremely
simple
electronic
circuit
it
fell
through
the
frigid
air
of
the
flattened
pole
of
donet
three
and
it
struck
the
side
of
a
sloping
ice
mountain
and
bounced
and
slid
down
to
a
valley
and
buried
itself
in
snow
and
only
instants
later
the
small
hole
left
by
its
fall
was
filled
in
and
covered
up
completely
by
snow
riding
on
a
hundred
mile
gale
it
was
undiscoverable
it
was
irretrievable
no
device
of
man
could
detect
or
recover
it
kim
himself
could
not
have
told
where
it
fell
kim
then
sighted
the
starshine
on
another
distant
target
and
found
the
planet
arth
and
dropped
a
small
metal
object
into
the
depths
of
the
humid
and
festering
jungles
along
its
equator
human
beings
could
live
only
in
the
polar
regions
of
arth
then
he
visited
a
certain
planet
in
the
solar
system
of
tabor
and
a
small
metal
case
went
twisting
through
deep
water
down
to
the
seabed
of
its
ocean
he
dropped
another
on
the
shifting
desert
sands
which
cover
one
third
of
sind
where
an
emperor
and
council
rule
in
the
name
of
a
non
existent
republic
and
yet
another
on
a
planet
of
megar
where
an
otherwise
unidentified
queen
amritha
held
imperial
power
and
others
he
dropped
one
small
metal
case
secured
from
a
merchant
prince
on
spicus
five
on
each
of
the
planets
whose
troops
had
moved
into
the
planets
left
defenseless
by
the
vanishment
of
ades
i
wanted
to
do
that
myself
because
what
we
ve
got
to
do
next
is
dangerous
and
we
may
get
killed
he
told
dona
drily
but
now
we
re
sure
that
men
won
t
stay
slaves
forever
and
now
we
can
try
to
do
something
about
ades
i
m
afraid
our
chances
are
pretty
slim
one
chance
in
a
million
in
spite
of
his
pessimism
kim
settled
down
to
the
fine
calculations
required
for
a
voyage
to
a
blue
white
dwarf
star
not
readily
distinguished
from
others
most
inhabited
planets
of
course
circled
sol
type
suns
light
much
different
from
that
in
which
the
race
had
developed
was
apt
to
have
produced
vegetation
inimical
to
humanity
and
useful
vegetation
did
not
thrive
and
of
course
sol
type

are
most
readily
spotted
by

navigators
as
he
checked
his
course
with

charts
dona
spoke
softly
thanks
kim
for
what
for
not
wanting
to
put
me
in
safety
when
you
re
going
to
do
something
dangerous
i
wouldn
t
let
you
but
thanks
for
not
trying
mmmmh
said
kim
you
re
too
useful
he
lined
up
his
course
and
pressed
the
transmitter
drive
stud
on
the
control
panel
space
danced
a
momentary
saraband
and
there
was
a
blue
white
dwarf
two
hundred
million
miles
away
showing
barely
a
planet
sized
disk
but
pouring
out
a
pitiless
white
glare
that
hurt
the
eyes
that
s
it
said
kim
that
s
the
sun
alis
there
should
be
four
planets
but
we
re
looking
for
number
one
it
goes
out
beyond
two
at
aphelion
so
we
have
to
check
the
orbit
if
we
can
find
it
before
we
can
be
sure
no
we
should
be
able
to
tell
by
the
rotation
very
slow
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
demanded
dona
there
were
bright
spots
in
emptiness
which
the
electron
telescope
instantly
declared
to
be
planets
kim
set
up
cameras
for
pictures
alis
one
is
the
only
really
uninhabitable
planet
in
the
galaxy
that
s
inhabited
he
observed
painstakingly
it
belongs
to
pharos
three
i
understand
it
s
the
personal
property
of
the
king
it
has
no
atmosphere
in
spite
of
an
extremely
high
specific
gravity
and
a
reasonable
mass
but
the
plutonium
mines
have
been
worked
for
five
thousand
years
plutonium
mines
with
that
half
life
dona
said
skeptically
you
must
be
joking
no
said
kim
it
s
a
very
heavy
planet
loaded
with
uranium
and
stuff
from
bismuth
on
out
it
has
an
extremely
eccentric
orbit
as
i
told
you
at
aphelion
it
s
beyond
the
orbit
of
pharos
two
at
perihelion
when
it
s
nearest
to
its
sun
it
just
barely
misses
roche
s
limit
the
limit
of
nearness
a
satellite
can
come
to
its
primary
without
being
torn
apart
by
tidal
strains
and
at
its
nearest
to
its
sun
it
s
bombarded
with
everything
a
sun
can
fling
out
into
space
from
its
millions
of
tons
of
disintegrating
atoms
alpha
rays
beta
rays
gamma
particles
neutrons
and
everything
else
pour
onto
its
surface
as
if
it
were
being
bombarded
by
a
cyclotron
with
a
beam
the
size
of
a
planet
s
surface
you
see
what
happens
dona
looked
startled
but
kim
every
particle
of
the
whole
surface
would
become
terrifically
radioactive
it
would
kill
a
man
to
land
on
it
according
to
my
merchant
prince
friend
on
spicus
five
it
did
kill
the
first
men
to
set
foot
on
it
but
the
point
is
that
its
heavy
elements
have
been
bombarded
and
most
of
its
uranium
has
gone
on
over
to
plutonium
and
americium
and
curium
in
ancient
days
when
it
went
out
on
the
long
sweep
away
from
its
sun
it
cooled
off
enough
for
men
to
land
on
it
at
its
farthest
out
point
with
shielded
space
suits
they
were
able
to
mine
its
substance
for
four
to
five
months
before
heat
and
rising
induced
radio
activity
drove
them
off
again
then
they
d
wait
for
it
to
cool
off
once
more
on
its
next
trip
around
they
went
to
it
with
space
ships
and
the
last
space
line
in
the
first
galaxy
ran
plutonium
and
americium
and
the
other
radio
actives
to
a
matter
transmitter
from
which
they
could
be
distributed
all
over
the
galaxy
but
it
wasn
t
very
efficient
they
could
only
mine
for
four
or
five
months
every
four
years
all
their
equipment
was
melted
and
ruined
when
they
were
able
to
land
again
a
few
hundred
years
ago
however
they
solved
the
problem
dona
stared
out
the
vision
ports
there
were
two
planets
which
might
be
the
one
in
question
but
there
were
only
three
in
sight
how
did
they
solve
it
dona
asked
somebody
invented
a
shield
said
kim
as
drily
as
before
it
was
a
force
field
it
has
the
property
of
a
magnetic
field
on
a
conductor
with
a
current
in
it
except
that
it
acts
on
mass
as
such
a
current
carrying
conductor
in
a
magnetic
field
tends
to
move
at
right
angles
both
to
the
current
and
the
field
this
force
field
acts
as
if
mass
were
an
electric
charge
anything
having
mass
entering
the
field
tries
to
move
sidewise
the
faster
it
moves
the
stronger
the
sidewise
impulse
neutrons
gamma
particles
met
rays
and
even
electrons
have
mass
so
has
light
everything
moving
that
hits
the
shielding
field
moves
sidewise
to
its
original
course
radiation
from
the
sun
isn
t
reflected
at
right
angles
so
with
the
shield
up
men
can
stay
on
the
planet
when
it
is
less
than
three
diameters
from
its
sun
no
heat
reaches
it
no
neutrons
no
radiations
at
all
it
doesn
t
heat
up
and
that
s
the
answer
for
three
months
in
every
four
year
revolution
they
have
to
keep
the
shield
up
all
the
time
for
three
months
more
they
keep
it
up
intermittently
flashing
it
on
for
fractions
of
a
second
at
a
time
just
enough
to
temper
the
amount
of
heat
they
get
they
live
on
great
platforms
of
uranium
glass
domed
in
when
they
go
out
mining
they
wear
shielded
space
suits
and
work
in
shielded
machines
the
whole
trick
was
worked
out
about
five
hundred
years
ago
they
say
and
the
last
space
line
went
out
of
existence
because
they
could
use
a
matter
transmitter
for
all
but
six
of
our
months
of
that
planet
s
year
and
did
you
find
out
how
it
s
done
asked
dona
hardly
said
kim
the
planet
belongs
to
the
king
of
pharos
three
even
five
hundred
years
ago
the
governments
of
all
the
planets
were
quite
tight
corporations
naturally
pharos
wouldn
t
let
the
secret
get
out
there
are
other
planets
so
close
to
their
primaries
that
they
re
radioactive
if
the
secret
were
to
be
disclosed
there
d
be
competition
there
d
be
other
plutonium
mines
in
operation
so
he
s
managed
to
keep
it
to
himself
but
we
ve
got
to
find
out
the
trick
there
was
silence
kim
began
to
check
over
the
pictures
the
cameras
had
taken
and
developed
he
shook
his
head
then
he
stared
at
a
photograph
which
showed
the
blue
white
dwarf
itself
his
face
looked
suddenly
very
drawn
and
tired
kim
said
dona
presently
it
s
stupid
of
me
but
i
don
t
see
how
you
re
going
to
learn
the
secret
kim
put
the
picture
on
the
enlarger
for
examination
in
a
greater
size
they
made
the
shield
to
keep
things
out
he
said
wearily
radiation
charged
particles
neutrons
everything
the
planet
simply
can
t
be
reached
not
even
by
matter
transmitters
when
the
shield
is
up
but
by
the
same
token
nothing
can
leave
the
planet
either
it
can
t
even
be
spotted
from
space
because
the
light
of
the
sun
isn
t
reflected
it
s
deflected
to
a
right
angled
course
you
might
pick
it
up
if
it
formed
a
right
angled
triangle
with
you
and
the
sun
or
you
might
spot
it
in
transit
across
the
sun
s
disk
but
that
s
all
yes
the
shield
was
a
special
job
said
kim
for
a
special
purpose
it
was
not
a
weapon
but
there
were
all
those
planets
that
could
be
grabbed
if
only
ades
were
knocked
out
so
why
shouldn
t
king
pharos
sneak
a
force
field
generator
on
to
ades
when
the
field
went
on
ades
would
be
invisible
and
unreachable
from
outside
and
the
outside
would
be
unreachable
from
it
space
ships
couldn
t
get
through
the
field
matter
transmitters
couldn
t
operate
through
it
if
a
few
technicians
were
sneaked
to
ades
as
supposed
exiles
and
promised
adequate
reward
don
t
you
think
they
d
hide
out
somewhere
and
turn
on
that
field
and
leave
it
on
until
the
folk
on
ades
had
starved
or
gone
mad
horrified
dona
stared
at
him
she
went
pale
oh
horrible
the
sky
would
be
black
always
never
a
glimmer
of
light
no
stars
no
moons
no
sun
the
plants
would
die
and
rot
and
the
people
would
grow
bleached
and
pale
and
finally
they
d
starve
all
but
the
little
gang
hidden
away
in
a
well
provisioned
hide
out
said
kim
grimly
i
think
that
s
what
s
happened
to
ades
or
is
happening
and
this
is
the
solar
system
where
the
little
trick
was
worked
out
i
d
hoped
simply
to
raid
the
generator
and
find
out
how
it
worked
which
would
be
dangerous
enough
look
he
pointed
to
the
projected
image
of
the
sun
there
was
a
tiny
dot
against
its
surface
it
was
almost
it
seemed
bathed
in
the
tentacular
arms
of
flaming
gases
flung
up
from
the
sun
s
surface
there
s
the
planet
said
kim
at
its
closest
to
the
sun
with
the
shield
up
so
that
nothing
can
reach
its
surface
nothing
and
that
includes
space
ships
such
as
this
and
at
that
distance
dona
the
hard
radiation
from
the
sun
would
go
right
through
the
starshine
and
kill
us
in
seconds
before
we
could
get
within
millions
of
miles
of
the
planet
if
there
s
any
place
in
the
universe
that
s
unapproachable
there
it
is
it
may
be
anything
up
to
three
months
before
the
shield
goes
down
even
for
fractions
of
a
second
at
a
time
and
my
guess
is
that
the
people
on
ades
won
t
last
that
long
they
ve
had
days
in
which
to
grow
hopeless
already
want
to
gamble
dona
looked
at
him
he
regarded
her
steadily
whatever
you
say
kim
sixteen
million
lives
on
ades
besides
other
aspects
of
the
situation
said
kim
the
odds
against
us
are
probably
about
the
same
sixteen
million
to
one
that
makes
it
a
fair
bet
we
ll
try
he
got
up
and
began
to
tinker
with
the
radiation
operated
relay
which
turned
off
the
transmitter
drive
presently
he
looked
up
i
m
glad
i
married
you
dona
he
said
gruffly
as
the
starshine
moved
closer
in
the
feeling
in
the
control
room
grew
tense
the
little
ship
had
advanced
to
within
twenty
millions
of
miles
of
the
blue
white
sun
and
even
at
that
distance
there
was
a
detectable
x
ray
intensity
kim
had
turned
on
a
geiger
counter
and
it
was
silent
simply
because
there
was
no
measurable
interval
between
its
discharges
a
neutron
detector
showed
an
indication
very
close
to
the
danger
mark
but
kim
had
the
starshine
s
nose
pointed
to
the
intolerably
glaring
sun
the
electron
telescope
showed
the
sun
s
surface
filling
all
its
field
and
because
the
illumination
had
been
turned
so
low
raging
sun
storms
could
be
seen
on
the
star
s
disk
against
it
the
black
silhouette
of
the
planet
was
clear
it
was
small
kim
estimated
its
diameter
at
no
more
than
six
thousand
miles
the
starshine
s
gyros
hummed
softly
and
the
field
of
the
telescope
swayed
until
the
planet
was
centered
exactly
there
was
a
little
sweat
on
kim
s
forehead
i
don
t
mind
taking
the
chance
myself
dona
he
said
dry
throated
but
i
hate
to
think
of
you
if
we
miss
we
ll
flash
into
the
sun
and
never
know
it
said
dona
smiling
it
ll
be
all
over
in
the
skillionth
of
a
second
if
we
miss
but
we
won
t
we
re
aiming
for
the
disk
of
the
planet
he
reminded
her
we
have
to
go
in
on
transmitter
speed
to
cut
the
time
of
our
exposure
to
hard
radiation
that
speed
will
make
the
time
of
exposure
effectively
zero
but
we
have
to
move
at
a
huge
multiple
of
the
speed
of
light
and
we
have
to
stop
short
of
that
planet
it
may
not
be
possible
do
you
want
me
to
press
the
button
kim
dona
said
softly
he
took
a
deep
breath
i
ll
do
it
thanks
dona
he
put
his
finger
on
the
stud
that
would
throw
the
ship
into
transmitter
drive
aimed
straight
at
the
disk
of
planet
against
the
inferno
of
sun
beyond
there
was
nothing
more
certain
than
that
to
miss
the
planet
would
fling
them
instantly
into
the
sun
and
there
was
nothing
more
absurd
than
to
expect
to
come
out
of
transmitter
drive
within
any
given
number
of
millions
of
miles
much
less
within
a
few
thousands
but
kim
pressed
the
stud
instantly
there
was
blackness
before
them
a
monstrous
absolute
blackness
filled
half
the
firmament
it
was
the
force
field
shielded
planet
blotting
out
its
sun
and
half
the
stars
of
the
galaxy
kim
had
made
a
bull
s
eye
on
a
target
relatively
the
size
of
a
dinner
plate
at
eleven
hundred
yards
more
than
that
he
had
stopped
short
of
his
target
equivalent
to
stopping
a
bullet
three
inches
short
of
that
place
he
said
in
a
queer
voice
the
relay
worked
even
backward
dona
dark
barrier
for
a
time
kim
sat
still
and
sweat
poured
out
on
his
skin
because
their
chances
had
seemed
slight
indeed
to
stop
a
space
ship
at
transmitter
speed
was
impossible
with
manual
means
anyhow
it
could
cross
a
galaxy
in
the
tenth
of
a
millisecond
so
kim
had
devised
a
radiation
operated
relay
which
threw
off
the
drive
when
the
total
radiation
reaching
a
sensitive
plate
in
the
bow
had
reached
an
adjustable
total
if
in
an
ordinary
flight
the
starshine
headed
into
a
sun
unlikely
as
such
an
occurrence
was
the
increased
light
striking
the
relay
plate
would
throw
off
the
drive
before
harm
came
but
this
time
they
had
needed
to
approach
fatally
close
to
a
star
so
kim
had
reversed
the
operation
of
the
relay
it
would
throw
off
the
drive
when
the
amount
of
light
reaching
it
dropped
below
a
certain
minimum
that
could
happen
only
if
the
ship
came
up
behind
the
planet
so
the
sun
was
blacked
out
by
the
world
s
shadowed
night
side
it
had
happened
the
glare
was
cut
off
the
transmitter
drive
followed
the
starshine
floated
within
a
bare
few
million
miles
perhaps
less
than
one
million
of
a
blue
white
dwarf
star
and
the
two
humans
in
the
ship
were
alive
because
they
had
between
them
and
the
sun
s
atomic
furnaces
a
planet
some
six
thousand
miles
in
diameter
we
don
t
know
how
our
velocity
matches
this
thing
said
kim
after
an
instant
we
could
be
drifting
toward
the
edge
of
the
shadow
you
watch
the
stars
all
around
make
sure
i
head
directly
for
that
blackness
when
we
touch
i
ll
see
what
i
can
find
out
he
reversed
the
ship
s
direction
he
let
the
starshine
float
down
backward
the
mass
of
unsubstantial
darkness
seemed
to
swell
it
engulfed
more
and
more
of
the
cosmos
a
long
long
time
later
there
was
a
strange
sensation
in
the
feel
of
things
dona
gave
a
little
cry
kim
i
feel
queer
so
queer
kim
moved
heavily
his
body
resisted
any
attempt
at
motion
and
yet
he
felt
a
horrible
tension
within
him
as
if
every
molecule
were
attempting
to
fly
apart
from
every
other
molecule
the
controls
of
the
ship
moved
sluggishly
each
part
of
each
device
seemed
to
have
a
vast
inertia
but
the
controls
did
yield
the
drive
did
come
on
a
little
later
the
sensation
ended
but
both
kim
and
dona
felt
utterly
exhausted
it
was
getting
dark
too
said
dona
she
trembled
when
we
tried
to
move
said
kim
our
arms
had
a
tendency
to
move
at
right
angles
to
the
way
we
wanted
them
to
at
all
the
possible
right
angles
at
once
that
was
the
edge
of
the
shield
dona
now
we
ll
see
what
we
ve
got
he
uncovered
the
recording
cabinet
there
had
been
no
need
to
set
up
instruments
especially
for
the
analysis
of
the
field
they
had
been
a
part
of
the
starshine
s
original
design
for
exploration
now
kim
read
the
records
cosmic
ray
intensity
went
down
he
reported
studying
the
tapes
the
dielectric
constant
of
space
changed
it
just
soared
up
the
relationship
of
mass
to
inertia
that
particular
gadget
never
recorded
anything
significant
before
dona
in
theory
it
should
have
detected
space
warps
actually
it
never
amounted
to
anything
but
a
quantitative
measure
of
gravitation
on
a
planet
one
landed
on
but
it
went
wild
in
that
field
and
here
look
he
exultantly
held
out
a
paper
recording
glance
at
that
dona
see
a
magnetometer
to
record
the
strength
of
the
magnetic
field
on
a
new
planet
it
recorded
the
ship
s
own
field
in
the
absence
of
any
other
and
the
ship
s
field
dropped
to
zero
do
you
see
do
you
i
m
afraid
not
admitted
dona
but
she
smiled
at
the
expression
on
kim
s
face
it
s
the
answer
said
kim
zestfully
still
i
don
t
know
how
that
blasted
field
is
made
but
i
know
now
how
it
works
neutrons
have
no
magnetic
field
but
this
thing
turns
them
aside
alpha
and
beta
and
gamma
radiation
do
have
magnetic
fields
but
this
thing
turns
them
aside
too
and
the
point
is
that
it
neutralizes
their
magnetic
fields
because
otherwise
it
couldn
t
start
to
turn
them
aside
so
if
we
make
a
magnetic
field
too
strong
for
the
field
to
counter
it
won
t
be
able
to
turn
aside
anything
in
that
magnetic
area
the
maximum
force
field
strength
needed
for
the
planet
is
simply
equal
to
the
top
magnetic
field
the
sun
may
project
so
far
if
we
can
bury
the
starshine
in
magnetic
flux
that
the
force
field
can
t
handle
he
grinned
he
hugged
her
and
there
s
a
loop
around
the
starshine
s
hull
for
space
radio
use
he
cried
i
ll
run
a
really
big
current
through
that
loop
and
we
ll
try
again
we
should
be
able
to
put
quite
a
lot
of
juice
through
a
six
turn
loop
and
get
a
flux
density
that
will
curl
your
hair
he
set
to
work
beaming
it
took
him
less
than
half
an
hour
to
set
up
a
series
wound
generator
in
the
airlock
couple
in
a
thermo
cell
to
the
loop
so
it
would
cool
the
generator
as
the
current
flowed
and
thereby
reduce
its
internal
resistance
now
he
said
we
ll
try
once
more
the
more
juice
that
goes
through
the
outfit
the
colder
the
generator
will
get
and
the
less
its
resistance
will
be
and
the
more
current
it
will
make
and
the
stronger
the
magnetic
field
will
be
he
flipped
a
switch
there
was
a
tiny
humming
noise
a
meter
needle
swayed
over
and
stayed
the
starshine
ventured
into
the
black
globe
below
nothing
happened
nothing
happened
at
all
the
stars
are
blotted
out
kim
dona
at
last
said
uneasily
but
you
feel
all
right
don
t
you
he
grinned
like
an
ape
in
his
delight
why
yes
i
feel
unusually
good
said
kim
happily
the
vision
screens
were
utterly
blank
the
ports
opened
upon
absolute
blackness
blackness
so
dead
and
absorbent
that
it
seemed
more
than
merely
lack
of
light
it
seemed
like
something
horrible
pressing
against
the
ports
and
trying
to
thrust
itself
in
and
suddenly
a
screen
glowed
faintly
and
then
another
then
there
was
a
greenish
glow
in
the
ports
and
dona
looked
out
and
down
above
was
that
blackness
complete
and
absolute
but
below
seen
with
utter
clarity
because
of
the
absence
of
atmosphere
lay
a
world
nothing
grew
upon
it
nothing
moved
it
was
raw
naked
rock
with
an
unholy
luminescence
here
and
there
the
glow
was
brighter
where
mineral
deposits
contained
more
highly
active
material
the
surface
was
tortured
and
twisted
in
swirled
stained
writhings
of
formerly
melted
rock
they
looked
they
saw
no
sign
of
human
life
nor
any
sign
that
humans
had
ever
been
there
but
after
all
even
five
thousand
years
of
mining
on
a
globe
six
thousand
miles
through
would
not
involve
the
disturbance
of
more
than
a
fraction
of
its
surface
we
did
it
said
kim
the
shield
can
be
broken
through
by
anything
with
a
strong
enough
magnetic
field
we
won
t
disturb
the
local
inhabitants
they
undoubtedly
have
orders
to
kill
anybody
who
incredibly
manages
to
intrude
we
can
t
afford
to
take
a
chance
we
ve
got
to
get
back
to
ades
he
pointed
the
starshine
straight
up
he
drove
her
slowly
at
the
ceiling
of
impenetrable
black
he
worked
upon
the
transmitter
drive
relay
he
adjusted
it
to
throw
the
starshine
into
transmitter
speed
the
instant
normal
starlight
appeared
ahead
the
ship
swam
slowly
upward
suddenly
there
was
a
momentary
impression
of
reeling
dancing
stars
kim
swung
the
bow
about
now
for
ades
he
said
gleefully
did
you
know
dona
that
once
upon
a
time
the
word
ades
meant
hell
the
stars
reeled
again
they
found
ades
knowing
how
now
it
was
not
too
difficult
there
were
two
positions
from
which
it
could
be
detected
one
was
a
position
in
which
it
was
on
a
line
between
the
starshine
and
the
sun
the
other
was
a
position
in
which
the
invisible
planet
the
space
ship
and
the
sun
formed
the
three
points
of
a
right
angled
triangle
with
ades
in
the
ninety
degree
corner
kim
sent
the
little
ship
in
a
great
circle
beyond
the
planet
s
normal
orbit
watching
for
it
to
appear
where
such
an
imaginary
triangle
would
be
formed
the
deflected
light
of
the
sun
would
spread
out
in
a
circular
flat
thin
plane
and
somewhere
about
the
circuit
the
starshine
had
to
run
through
it
it
would
be
a
momentary
sight
only
and
it
would
not
be
bright
it
would
be
utterly
unlike
the
steady
radiance
of
a
normal
planet
such
flashes
if
seen
before
would
have
been
dismissed
as
illusions
or
as
reflections
from
within
the
ship
even
so
it
was
a
long
long
time
before
dona
called
out
quickly
there
she
said
and
pointed
kim
swung
the
starshine
back
he
saw
the
dim
diffused
spectre
of
sun
s
reflection
they
drove
for
it
and
presently
a
minute
dark
space
appeared
it
grew
against
the
background
of
a
radiant
galaxy
and
presently
was
a
huge
blackness
and
the
starshine
s
space
radio
loop
was
once
more
filled
with
a

in
the
airlock
the
ship
ventured
cautiously
into
the
black
and
later
there
were
lonely
unspeakably
desolate
little
lights
of
the
lost
world
down
below
kim
drove
for
them
with
a
reckless
exultation
he
landed
in
the
very
centre
of
a
despairing
small
settlement
which
had
believed
itself
dead
and
damned
or
at
any
rate
doomed
he
shouted
out
his
coming
and
dona
cried
out
the
news
that
the
end
of
darkness
was
near
and
men
came
surging
toward
her
to
listen
but
it
was
dona

explained
her
eyes
shining
in
the
light
of
the
torches
men
held
up
toward
her
kim
had
gone
back
into
the
ship
and
was
using
the
communicators
to
rouse
out
the
mayors
of
every
municipality
and
to
say
he
had
just
reached
the
planet
from
terranova
there
was
no
time
to
tell
of
adventures
in
between
and
he
needed
atmosphere
fliers
to
gather
around
him
at
once
with
armed
men
in
them
for
urgent
business
connected
with
the
restoration
of
a
normal
state
of
affairs
they
came
swiftly
flittering
down
out
of
the
blackness
overhead
to
land
in
the
lights
of
huge
bonfires
built
by
kim
s
orders
and
kim
on
the
communicators
asked
for
other
bonfires
everywhere
to
help
in
navigation
and
then
he
went
out
to
be
greeted
by
the
bellowing
mayor
of
steadheim
what
s
this
he
roared
no
sunlight
no
stars
no
matter
transmitter
no
ships
our
ships
took
off
and
never
came
back
what
the
devil
happened
to
the
universe
kim
grinned
at
him
the
universe
is
all
right
it
s
ades
somewhere
on
the
planet
there
s
a
generator
throwing
out
a
force
field
it
will
have
plenty
of
power
that
generator
maybe
i
can
pick
it
up
with
the
instruments
of
the
starshine
but
we
ll
be
sure
to
find
it
with
magnetic
compasses
what
we
want
is
for
everyone
to
flick
their
compasses
and
note
the
time
of
swing
we
want
to
find
the
place
where
the
swings
get
slower
and
slower
when
we
find
a
place
where
the
compasses
point
steadily
without
a
flicker
not
even
up
and
down
we
ll
be
at
the
generator
and
everybody
put
on
navigation
lights
or
there
ll
be
crashes
he
lifted
the
starshine
and
by
communicator
kept
track
of
the
search
toward
the
polar
regions
was
the
logical
hiding
place
for
the
generator
because
there
the
chilly
climate
of
ades
became
frigid
and
there
were
no
inhabitants
but
it
was
a
long
search
hours
went
by
before
a
signal
came
from
a
quarter
way
around
the
globe
then
the
starshine
drove
through
darkness
but
cautiously
with
atmosphere
fliers
all
about
and
there
was
an
area
where
the
planet
s
magnetic
field
grew
weaker
and
weaker
and
then
a
space
in
which
there
was
no
magnetic
field
but
in
the
darkness
they
could
find
no
sign
of
a
depot
gadget
of
hope
grimly
kim
set
the
starshine
on
the
ground
in
the
very
centre
of
the
dark
area
and
started
the
generator
in
the
airlock
when
it
worked
at
its
utmost
and
nothing
happened
kim
threw
in
the
leads
of
the
ship
s
full
engine
power
there
was
a
surging
of
all
the
terrific
energy
the
ship
s
engines
could
give
then
the
radio
loop
went
white
hot
and
melted
with
a
sputtering
arc
as
the
circuit
broke
abruptly
the
stars
appeared
overhead
and
simultaneously
came
the
leaping
flame
of
a
rumbling
explosion
then
followed
the
flare
of
fuel
burning
savagely
in
the
night
the
starshine
s
full
power
had
burned
out
the
force
field
generator
an
instant
before
the
loop
melted
to
uselessness
kim
was
with
the
men
who
ran
toward
the
scene
of
the
explosion
and
he
would
have
tried
to
stop
the
killing
of
the
other
men
who
ran
out
of
underground
burrows
but
the
victims
would
not
have
it
they
expected
to
be
killed
and
they
fought
wildly
all
died
later
kim
inspected
the
shattered
apparatus
which
now
lay
in
pieces
but
he
thought
it
could
be
reconstructed
and
perhaps
in
time
understood
night
s
nearly
over
he
announced
to
those
who
prowled
through
the
wreckage
it
shouldn
t
be
much
more
than
an
hour
until
dawn
if
i
hadn
t
seen
sunlight
for
a
week
or
more
i
think
i
d
go
for
a
look
at
the
sunrise
in
seconds
the
first
atmosphere
flier
took
off
in
minutes
the
last
of
them
were
gone
they
flew
like
great
black
birds
beneath
the
starlight
headed
for
the
east
to
greet
a
sun
they
had
not
expected
to
see
again
but
the
mayor
of
steadheim
stayed
behind
hah
he
said
growling
it
s
over
my
head
i
don
t
know
what
happened
and
i
never
expect
to
understand
how
are
my
sons
in
the
new
galaxy
fine
when
last
we
heard
said
dona
smiling
come
into
the
ship
he
tramped
into
the
living
space
of
the
starshine
he
eased
himself
into
a
seat
now
tell
me
what
s
gone
on
and
what
s
happened
and
why
he
commanded
dictatorially
kim
told
him
as
well
as
he
could
the
mayor
of
steadheim
fumed
took
over
the
twenty
one
planets
eh
he
sputtered
we
ll
attend
to
that
we
ll
take
a
few
ships
go
over
there
and
punish
em
i
suspect
they
ve
pulled
out
said
kim
if
they
haven
t
they
will
and
soon
the
gracious
majesties
and
magnificents
and
the
other
planetary
rulers
who
essayed
some
easy
conquests
have
other
need
for
their
soldiers
now
plenty
of
need
eh
what
cried
the
mayor
what
s
the
matter
those
rulers
have
got
to
have
a
lesson
we
didn
t
try
to
free
the
whole
galaxy
because
it
was
too
big
a
job
but
it
looks
like
we
ll
have
to
try
i
doubt
the
need
said
kim
amused
after
all
it
s
the
disciplinary
circuit
which
has
enslaved
the
human
race
when
the
psychogram
of
every
citizen
is
on
file
and
a
disciplinarian
has
only
to
put
his
card
in
the
machinery
and
press
a
button
to
have
that
man
searched
out
by
disciplinary
circuit
waves
and
tortured
wherever
he
may
be
when
that
s
possible
any
government
is
absolute
men
can
t
revolt
when
the
whole
population
or
any
part
of
it
can
be
tortured
at
the
ruler
s
whim
dona
s
expression
changed
kim
she
said
accusingly
those
things
you
got
on
spicus
five
and
dropped
on
the
planets
the
soldiers
came
from
what
were
they
i
ll
tell
you
said
kim
the
disciplinary
circuit
is
all
right
to
keep
criminals
in
hand
not
rebels
like
us
but
thieves
and
such
and
it
does
keep
down
the
number
of
officials
who
have
to
be
supported
by
the
state
police
and
guards
aren
t
really
needed
on
a
free
planet
with
the
disciplinary
circuit
in
action
it
s
a
useful
machine
for
the
protection
of
law
and
order
the
trouble
is
that
like
all
machines
its
use
has
been
abused
now
it
serves
tyranny
so
i
made
a
device
to
defend
freedom
the
mayor
of
steadheim
cocked
a
suspicious
eye
upon
him
i
procured
a
little
gadget
said
kim
i
dropped
the
gadget
in
various
places
where
it
wasn
t
likely
to
be
found
if
one
man
is
under
disciplinary
circuit
punishment
or
two
or
three
or
four
that
s
not
unreasonable
on
a
great
planet
nothing
happens
but
if
twenty
five
or
fifty
or
a
hundred
are
punished
at
once
the
disciplinary
circuit
is
blown
out
as
i
just
blew
out
that
force
field
generator
the
mayor
of
steadheim
considered
this
information
ha
hmmm
he
said
profoundly
criminals
can
be
kept
down
but
a
revolt
can
t
be
suppressed
kim
went
on
the
soldiers
who
are
occupying
the
twenty
one
planets
will
be
called
back
to
put
down
revolts
as
soon
as
the
people
discover
the
disciplinary
circuits
on
their
planets
are
blowing
out
and
that
they
blow
out
again
as
fast
as
they
re
re
made
and
used
hm
said
the
mayor
of
steadheim
not
bad
and
the
rebels
will
have
some
very
tasty
ideas
of
what
to
do
to
the
folk
who
ve
tyrannized
over
them
no
troops
can
stop
a
revolt
nowadays
not
for
long
no
not
for
long
said
kim
no
government
will
be
able
to
rule
with
a
dissatisfied
population
not
if
it
has
a
little
gadget
hidden
somewhere
that
will
blow
out
the
disciplinary
circuit
if
it
s
used
to
excess
good
enough
good
enough
grumbled
the
mayor
when
rulers
are
kept
busy
satisfying
their
people
they
won
t
have
time
to
bother
political
offenders
that
s
sensible
enough
but
it
s
too
fiendish
bad
that
only
those
twenty
planets
have
the
gadgets
on
them
i
suppose
we
criminals
will
have
to
set
up
a
factory
and
make
them
and
then
visit
all
the
three
hundred
million
inhabited
planets
one
by
one
and
drop
one
little
contrivance
on
every
one
but
it
ll
take
us
centuries
space
that
s
a
pity
it
won
t
take
centuries
said
kim
drily
i
made
a
deal
with
a
factory
owner
on
spicus
five
he
turned
out
the
ones
i
personally
dropped
in
exchange
for
the
design
he
s
going
to
manufacture
them
in
quantity
he
ll
make
a
fortune
out
of
them
how
who
ll
buy
them
demanded
the
mayor
every
king
will
outlaw
them
space
yes
they
ll
be
scared
to
death
the
kings
said
kim
more
drily
than
before
the
kings
and
despots
and
emperors
will
be
the
ones
to
buy
them
they
ll
want
them
to
drop
in
their
neighbors
dominions
every
king
or
ruler
will
buy
a
few
to
put
where
they
will
weaken
his
enemies
and
every
one
has
enemies
we
don
t
have
to
plant
the
gadgets
that
make
the
disciplinary
circuit
into
a
boomerang
we
ll
let
the
kings
weaken
each
other
and
bring
back
freedom
and
they
will
the
mayor
of
steadheim
puffed
in
his
breath
until
it
looked
as
if
he
would
explode
then
he
bellowed
with
laughter
make
the
tyrants
dethrone
each
other
he
roared
delightedly
they
ll
weaken
each
other
until
they
find
they
ve
their
own
people
to
deal
with
there
ll
be
a
fine
scramble
i
give
it
five
years
no
more
before
there
s
not
a
king
in
the
galaxy
who
dares
order
an
execution
without
a
jury
trial
first
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wished
said
kim
smiling
i
rather
like
the
idea
myself
the
mayor
heaved
himself
up
hah
he
said
still
chuckling
i
ll
go
back
to
my
wife
and
tell
her
to
come
outdoors
and
look
at
the
stars
what
will
you
two
do
next
sleep
i
suspect
said
kim
it
was
all
over
the
realization
made
him
aware
of
how
tired
he
was
we
ll
probably
put
in
twenty
four
hours
of
just
plain
slumber
then
we
ll
see
if
anything
more
needs
to
be
done
and
then
i
guess
dona
and
i
will
head
back
to
terranova
the
organizer
there
is
worried
about
a
shortage
of
textiles
to
the
devil
with
him
grunted
the
mayor
of
steadheim
we
ve
had
a
shortage
of
sunlight
you
re
a
good
man
kim
rendell
i
ll
tell
my
grandchildren
about
you
when
i
have
them
he
waved
grandly
and
went
out
a
little
later
his
flier
took
off
occulting
stars
as
it
rose
kim
closed
the
airlock
door
he
yawned
again
kim
said
dona
we
had
to
break
that
shield
but
it
was
dangerous
yes
said
kim
he
yawned
again
so
it
was
i
ll
be
glad
to
get
back
to
our
house
on
terranova
so
will
i
said
dona
her
face
had
become
determined
we
shouldn
t
even
think
of
leaving
it
again
kim
we
should
anchor
ourselves
to
it
so
nobody
would
think
of
asking
us
to
leave
a
good
idea
said
kim
if
it
could
be
done
dona
looked
critically
at
her
fingers
but
she
flushed
suddenly
it
could

said
softly

best
way
would
be
